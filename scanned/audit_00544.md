# Discrepancy In Allowed Supply

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Discrepancy in `batch_mint` and `mint`

In `collectible.move`, `batch_mint` and `mint` contain a small discrepancy in the allowed supply. Specifically, `batch_mint` utilizes the `<` operator in the length assertion check, which results in a maximum supply of `cap.max_supply - 1`, while `mint` utilizes the `<=` operator, which allows for the full `cap.max_supply` to be attained.

## Remediation

Modify the length assertion check in `batch_mint` to utilize the `<=` operator instead of the `<` operator.

## DIFF

```rust
// safe to downcast since the length will never be greater than u32::MAX
assert!(
    option::is_none(&cap.max_supply)
    - || cap.minted + (len as u32) < *option::borrow(&cap.max_supply)
    + || cap.minted + (len as u32) <= *option::borrow(&cap.max_supply)
, ECapReached);
```
