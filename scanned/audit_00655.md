# Permission Contract Access Control

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
Generally, it’s a good practice to use the friend concept in Move for better access control. In the contract `Permission`, the functions `set` and `unset` were declared as public. It is preferred to let them only be invoked by their friends.

```rust
public fun set(permission: &mut Permission, code: u64) {
    [..]
}

public fun unset(permission: &mut Permission, code: u64) {
    [..]
}
```

Though it is not possible to get `&mut Permission` of others, it is better to restrict the access of functions that modify the state of resources.

## Remediation

Use `public(friend)` instead of `public` for the setter to have better access control.

```rust
public(friend) fun set(permission: &mut Permission, code: u64);
public(friend) fun unset(permission: &mut Permission, code: u64);
```
