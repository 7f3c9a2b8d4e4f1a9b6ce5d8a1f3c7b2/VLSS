# Prevention of Cross-Chain Replay Attacks

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Fee Payload Update

Add `chain_id` to the fee payload, similar to how it is included in the mint payload. This prevents replay attacks, where a transaction could be relayed on a different chain. Adding `chain_id` ensures that signed fee transactions are only valid on the intended chain, preventing cross-chain replay attacks.

## Remediation

Modify the fee payload structure to include `chain_id`.
