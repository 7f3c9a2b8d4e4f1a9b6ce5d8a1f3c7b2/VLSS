# Insufficient Authentication Controls on Critical Services

## Summary
This report discusses the importance of using FIDO2 hardware security key authentication for critical services instead of relying on less secure methods such as SMS or authenticator apps. The impact of not using FIDO2 keys is high as it could lead to unauthorized access to important accounts and information. The recommendation is to disable other authentication options and only use FIDO2 keys for services such as AWS, Vercel, DNS registrar, Slack, Pagerduty, Twitter, and Discord. It is also advised to have a backup hardware key in case one gets lost or damaged and to use "cold" email addresses for critical service logins.

## Security Audit Findings

## Severity
**Medium Risk**

## Description
Critical services should use FIDO2 hardware security key authentication, instead of relying on less secure methods. FIDO2 hardware keys provide stronger security against phishing and account takeover compared to SMS or authenticator app 2FA.

## Severity Discussion
The impact is high as compromise of critical service accounts could allow unauthorized access to deployment infrastructure, treasury funds, or public communication channels. The likelihood is low - while the team has been targeted recently and these services present valuable targets, standard 2FA provides baseline protection against most attacks.

## Recommendation
Disable password, SMS, and authenticator app 2FA and other authentication options, and restrict authentication to passkey through FIDO2 enabled hardware security keys (such as Yubikey) for all critical services where available, including:

- AWS
- Vercel
- DNS registrar
- Slack
- PagerDuty
- Twitter
- Discord

For services where there is only one login (or for a singular admin account), add a secondary backup hardware security key in case one gets lost or damaged. Store the backup key in a physically separate location. Additionally, use "cold" email addresses for critical service logins as described in L-01.
