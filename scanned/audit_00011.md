**Update**
Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `1129233c721840a8ea4746fb2b9bf11f43fb39f8`.

**File(s) affected:**`position.move`

**Description:** When the asset price is zero, the `compute_margin_ratio()` function will incorrectly return a margin of 1.0. This means that long positions, which are actually underwater (MR of minus infinity), will appear to have a margin of 1.0. While this should not occur in practice, edge cases may exist.

**Recommendation:** We recommend specifically handling this edge case of `position_value == 0`, instead of only calculating the `margin_ratio` when `position_value > 0`.
