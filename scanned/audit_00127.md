# Missing Input Validation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `7f55712`. The client fixed 1.5.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3. The other issues remain unresolve

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`, `lending_core/sources/lending.move`

**Description:** The following functions lack proper input validation:

1.   `isolated_lending::isolated_lending`:
    1.   `set_pair_collateral_dust_amount()`: `collateral_dust_amount` is unbound and may have any value between zero and `MAX_U64`.
    2.   `set_pair_supply_cap()`: `supply_cap` neither has a lower nor an upper bound, allowing arbitrary caps, which may leave the pair temporarily in an inoperable state.
    3.   `set_pair_borrow_cap()`: `borrow_cap` neither has a lower nor an upper bound, allowing arbitrary caps, which may leave the pair temporarily in an inoperable state.
    4.   `set_pair_jump_interest_rate_model()`: All parameters are unbound and unchecked, with the exception of `utilization_kink_bps`, which however may assume any values between zero and `BPS_BASE`.
    5.   `create_pair_internal()`:
        1.   `liquidation_incentive_bps` not checked to be greater than or equal to `BASE_BPS` and smaller or equal to `MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS`.
        2.   `collateral_dust_amount` not checked to be within a reasonable bound.
        3.   `base_rate_bps` not checked to be within `BASE_BPS`.
        4.   `multiplier_bps` not checked to be within `BASE_BPS`.
        5.   `jump_multiplier_bps` not checked to be within `BASE_BPS`.

2.   `lending::lending`:
    1.   `set_market_jump_interest_rate_model()`: 
        1.   `base_rate_bps`, `multiplier_bps` and `jump_multiplier_bps` are not checked to be smaller than `BPS_BASE` or otherwise reasonably bound. 
        2.   It is not checked that `jump_multiplier_bps < multiplier_bps`, leading to no jump in rates after the kink point.
        3.   It is not checked that `utilization_kink_bps` is a reasonable value. Especially, it is not checked that `utilization_kink_bps  !== 0`. If `utilization_kink_bps === 0`, it would cause `borrow_interest_rate` to divide by zero. This _division by zero risk_ is particularly concerning as it would cause transaction failures for all operations that depend on interest rate calculations, including borrowing, supplying, and liquidations, potentially rendering markets unusable.

    2.   `set_market_rate_limit_internal()`: `window_max_qty` not checked to be non-zero or otherwise reasonably bound.
    3.   `deposit_reserve_fa()`: Missing call to `validate_fa_info()`.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding the recommended input validations. Especially, make sure that `utilization_kink_bps !== 0`, as the protocol would otherwise become unusable.
