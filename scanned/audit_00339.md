# CLEAR-TEXT PASSWORDS IN SOURCE CODE

## Summary
This bug report is about a security issue in the source code of an application. The report states that there are hard-coded credentials, which means that sensitive information such as passwords are written directly in the code. This is considered bad practice and can pose a risk if a hacker gains access to them. The report recommends securely storing and sharing secrets within the development team on a need-to-know basis. The code location of the credentials is in a file called ".env.development". The report gives a score for the impact and likelihood of the issue, with a recommendation to solve it. The report then mentions that the issue has been solved by the development team, with a link to the specific commit on GitHub. It also states that the password has been removed from the source code by the client team.

## Details
##### Description

Hard-coded clear-text credentials were found in the source code.
This is considered bad practice and may pose a risk for the application if a malicious user manages to access to some of them. Secrets should be securely stored and shared between the development team on a need to know basis. Additionally, these might be later re-used by someone and should they fall in the wrong hands, they could be used to access sensitive services and data.
