## Details
**Update**
Acknowledged by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> On purpose. In case we want to update it in the future.

**File(s) affected:**`bucket_usd/sources/usdb.move`

**Description:** The `bucket_v2_usd::usdb::init()` function uses `coin::create_currency()` to initialize `USDB`. The function then uses `transfer::share_object()` to share the object instead of freezing it. A better approach would be to freeze the object.

**Recommendation:** Unless changes to the coin metadata are intended, consider freezing this object.
