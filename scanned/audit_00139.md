# Asset Inventory System

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity: Low Risk

## Description
Thala lacks a formal system for tracking and managing critical assets including personal devices, hardware security modules, and service account access. Without a comprehensive asset inventory, the team faces increased risk during security incidents and may miss critical areas during access reviews or employee offboarding. The current state presents several risks:

- No central record of which personal devices have access to critical systems.
- Incomplete tracking of hardware wallets and signing devices.
- Service account access and privilege levels not systematically documented.
- Difficulty ensuring complete access removal during offboarding.
- Limited ability to perform security audits across all assets.
- Challenges in disaster recovery planning without full asset visibility.

## Recommendation
Implement a comprehensive asset inventory system with the following components:

### Personal Computing Devices
Track for each team member:

- Device type/model.
- Operating system and version.
- Status of security tools (antivirus, disk encryption).
- Access level to critical systems.
- Primary user and backup contact.
- Date of last security review.

### Hardware Security
Document for each device:

- Device type (e.g., Yubikey 5C, Ledger Nano X).
- Serial number.
- Assigned user.
- Associated accounts/services.

### Service Accounts
Track for each service:

- Service name and purpose.
- Account holders and access levels.
- Authentication method.

#### Current services requiring documentation:
- **Vercel**: Development team access (Member role).
- **AWS**: Infrastructure management.
- **GCP**: Validator and bot operations.
- **GitHub**: Repository access.
- **Coingecko**: API access.
- **Namecheap**: Domain management.
- **Google Workspace**: Team collaboration.
- **Twitter**: Social media management (Adam, San).

## Implementation Plan
1. **Create Initial Inventory**:
   - Use a secure, shared spreadsheet or documentation system.
   - Assign an owner responsible for maintenance.
   - Include all current team members and assets.
    
2. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Schedule quarterly reviews of all assets.
   - Update during any team member changes.
   - Review during security incidents.
   - Verify during compliance audits.
    
3. **Offboarding Integration**:
   - Add asset inventory review to offboarding checklist.
   - Include verification of access removal.
   - Document transfer of critical assets/accounts.
