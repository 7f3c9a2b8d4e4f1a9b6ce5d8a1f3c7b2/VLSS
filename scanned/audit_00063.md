**Update**
This issue was extensively discussed with the client. The client takes all measures in preventing bad debt and is confident in their abilities to quickly liquidate positions. In case bad debt should accumulate despite all measures, it will be covered by the client through liquidation of underwater positions at additional cost.

**File(s) affected:**`bucket_cdp/sources/vault.move`

**Description:** The protocol lacks mechanisms to handle positions becoming undercollateralized. During normal market conditions, positions are typically liquidated before reaching this state. However, when collateral prices rapidly decline (which is fairly common in the cryptocurrency market), liquidations may not execute quickly enough. The `liquidate()` function only provides proportional collateral, meaning liquidators are only incentivized while positions carry more collateral relative to their debt.

Once positions go underwater, the protocol depends entirely on altruistic liquidators willing to absorb losses. Even with centralized liquidators incentivized to maintain protocol health, this design creates systemic risk. Furthermore, the user whose position is now undercollateralized has no incentive to pay back the debt. Users aware of this vulnerability may trigger bank runs during market stress, causing cascading withdrawals that further destabilize the stablecoin's collateralization.

**Exploit Scenario:**

In the following, we discuss the potential impact of swift market movements on protocol health, illustrating the protocol's fragility in the absence of an embedded mechanism to alleviate bad debt.

Consider Alice who opens a position with $1,500 collateral to mint 1,000 `USDB`. A flash crash drops her collateral value to $600. At this point, neither Alice nor any rational liquidator has incentive to close the position - Alice won't repay $1,000 debt to recover $600 collateral, and liquidators won't pay $1,000 to receive $600 worth of assets. The position remains open indefinitely, continuously accruing interest that further inflates the protocol's unbacked debt burden.

As more positions become underwater during the crash, bad debt accumulates across the protocol. Sophisticated traders recognize the growing insolvency and begin buying `USDB` at a discount on exchanges (e.g., at $0.95) and immediately redeeming it through the `PSM` for $1.00 worth of stablecoins, extracting value from the PSM modules. This arbitrage continues until `PSM` reserves are exhausted or the oracle price of `USDB` becomes so low that the PSM no longer facilitates swapping. In either case, `USDB` loses its redemption backstop and enters free fall, potentially declining to the actual collateral backing ratio.

**Recommendation:** Design and implement a bad debt recovery system. In the following, we offer best practices to address this issue long-term:

1.   **Liquidation Incentive**: Create a mechanism to incentivize clearing underwater positions by minting additional `USDB` as "protocol debt" to compensate liquidators.

2.   **Protocol Reserve**: Redirect a portion of all protocol fees (interest accrual, future liquidation penalties, PSM swap fees) into a dedicated reserve buffer that can absorb bad debt. If "protocol debt" is ever created, a dedicated function can cover it using the protocol reserves.

3.   **Liquidation Fees**: Take an additional fee from liquidations that goes towards the protocol reserve buffer.

4.   **Emergency Recapitalization**: Implement debt auctions where governance tokens (if introduced) can be minted and sold to cover bad debt, and/or allow direct recapitalization contributions from the treasury or foundation during extreme events.

These mechanisms are essential for maintaining user confidence. Historical CDP failures demonstrate that protocols without proper bad debt handling may experience trust erosion, leading to bank runs that become self-fulfilling prophecies of protocol failure.
