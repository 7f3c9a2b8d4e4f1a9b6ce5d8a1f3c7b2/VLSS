# Add Mechanism to Remove Validators

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Validator Protocol

Once a validator joins the pool, its `OwnerCapability` is stored by the Ditto protocol and it is not possible for the validator to leave the protocol or recover its `OwnerCapability`.

## Remediation

Consider adding a mechanism for validators to remove themselves (and/or be kicked out) of the Ditto protocol.
