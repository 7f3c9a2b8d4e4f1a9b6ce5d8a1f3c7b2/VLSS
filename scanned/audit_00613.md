# Improper Interest Accumulation Calculation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Sync Interest Rate Calculation

`sync_interest_rate` derives the value of `days_elapsed` by dividing `seconds_elapsed` by the number of seconds in a day. This calculation truncates any remaining seconds, which may cause the value of `days_elapsed` to be rounded down.

As a result, if `seconds_elapsed` is equal to 1 day, 23 hours, and 59 minutes, the value of `days_elapsed` would be rounded down to one. Then, the new interest index would be calculated for only one day, and the last updated timestamp would be incorrect by 23 hours and 59 minutes. Consequently, the global interest index ratio and interest on vaults may be lower than expected.

## Remediation

Increment `interest_last_update_seconds` with `days_elapsed * SECONDS_IN_DAY` instead of directly setting it to the current timestamp.

## Patch

Fixed in #105.
