## Calculation Issue with `tipCapPct`

The calculation of `tipCapPct` in `fee::CalculatePriority` involves integer division (`Quo`) of `big.Int` values, yielding truncated results that are either zero or one. This poses a problem since `tipCapPct` is meant to represent a percentage value; however, integer division restricts it to integer values only.

## Remediation

Perform the division as a decimal instead of an integer.

## Patch

Fixed in PR #1368.
