# Missing Tick Step Validation

## Summary
The bug report discusses a potential issue within the vault module. The base_tick_step and limit_tick_step values, which are user-provided inputs, are not properly validated. This means that a malicious user could enter very high values for these steps, which could result in an integer overflow and disrupt the check_rebalance function. The report suggests either validating the values in the open_vault function or using the strategy values instead. The issue has been resolved in version 9333ce4.

## Details
## Open Vault Vulnerability

In `open_vault` within the vault module, the `base_tick_step` and `limit_tick_step` values are user-provided inputs and are not validated. This means a malicious user may enter substantially high values for these steps. Inside `check_rebalance`, these user-provided steps are multiplied by `tick_spacing`. This multiplication results in an integer overflow if the product (`limit_tick_step * tick_spacing` or `base_tick_step * tick_spacing`) is large. Consequently, the function may abort if an overflow occurs, effectively disrupting `check_rebalance_loop` and influencing the re-balancing logic.

```rust
> _vault.move_rust
public fun check_rebalance<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB, FeeType>(
    global_config: &GlobalConfig,
    strategy: &mut Strategy,
    vault_id: ID,
    clmm_pool: &mut Pool<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB, FeeType>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): CheckRebalance {
    [...]
    let base_tick_step = vault_info.base_tick_step;
    let limit_tick_step = vault_info.limit_tick_step;
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Either validate the values of `base_tick_step` and `limit_tick_step` in `open_vault` or utilize the strategy values instead.

## Patch

Resolved in `9333ce4`
