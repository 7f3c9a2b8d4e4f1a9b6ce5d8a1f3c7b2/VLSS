# Lack of spec on the modules

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
##### Description

The spec file intends to outline the common structure for specifications within this directory. The **masterchef/estaking** module is missing spec. This documentation is segmented into developer-focused messages and end-user-facing messages. These messages may be shown to the end user (the human) at the time that they will interact with the module.
