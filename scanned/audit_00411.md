# Lack Of Pause Functionality

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Claim Coin V2

`claim_coin_v2` handles the process of claiming SUI coins, ensuring that the claim is valid based on epoch and timestamp conditions. However, it does not utilize any pause flag to enable it to stop the claiming process. The absence of such a pausing mechanism may prevent the protocol from mitigating the impact of a vulnerability or temporarily restricting users from claiming, especially during critical periods such as protocol upgrades or network instability.

## Remediation

Add the `pause_claim` flag, which adds an extra layer of control and security to the protocol.

## Patch

Fixed in `62f3a77`
