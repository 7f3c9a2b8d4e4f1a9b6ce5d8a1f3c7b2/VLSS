## Issues Identified

1. **Add Liquidity Event Emission**
   In the current implementation of `pool::add_liquidity_weighted`, `AddLiquidityEvent` emits amounts (the raw values of assets initially provided to the function) instead of `remained_assets`, which is the actual amounts of assets the user deposited into the pool.

   ```rust
   >_ thalaswap_v2/sources/pool.move rust
   public fun add_liquidity_weighted(pool_obj: Object<Pool>, assets: vector<FungibleAsset>):
   ,→ (FungibleAsset, vector<FungibleAsset>) acquires PauseFlag, Pool {
   [...]
   event::emit(AddLiquidityEvent {
       pool_obj,
       metadata,
       amounts,
       minted_lp_token_amount: preview.minted_lp_token_amount,
       pool_balances: pool_balances(pool_obj),
   });
   (lp_token, refunds)
   }
   ```

2. **Swap Event Amount Logging**
   In the current implementations of `swap_exact_out_stable` and `swap_exact_out_metastable`, the `amount_in` value logged by the `SwapEvent` is provided by the users. However, the `amount_in` that is passed by the user may differ from the actual `amount_in` needed to achieve the desired output (`amount_out`).

   ```rust
   >_ thalaswap_v2/sources/pool.move rust
   public fun swap_exact_out_stable([...]) [...] {
   [...]
   event::emit(SwapEvent {
       pool_obj,
       metadata: pool_assets_metadata(pool_obj),
       idx_in: preview.idx_in,
       idx_out: preview.idx_out,
       amount_in,
       amount_out,
       total_fee_amount: preview.total_fee_amount,
       protocol_fee_amount: preview.protocol_fee_amount,
       pool_balances: pool_balances(pool_obj),
   });
   [...]
   }
   ```

## Remediation Steps

1. **For AddLiquidityEvent:**
   Replace `amounts` in `AddLiquidityEvent` with `remained_assets` since it represents the actual assets deposited into the pool.
   
2. **For SwapEvent:**
   Pass the exact input amount that was actually utilized in the swap (`preview.amount_in`) to `SwapEvent` to ensure proper logging of swap parameters.

## Patch Information

1. Fixed in commit `7df3ae8`.
