# Presence Of Unused Fields

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Code Cleanup Proposal

In both `storage.move` and `pool.move`, some fields within objects remain unused. The `ReserveData` object never utilizes the `is_isolated` field, while in the `PoolAdminCap` object, the `owners` and `admins` fields are similarly unused. These redundant fields serve no purpose within the current implementation, and removing them would simplify and improve the clarity of the code.

## Remediation

Remove the following fields:
1. `is_isolated` from `ReserveData`.
2. `owners` from `PoolAdminCap`.
3. `admins` from `PoolAdminCap`.
