## Fee Handling Logic Inconsistency in staking::stake_thAPT_v2

There is an inconsistency in the fee handling logic in `staking::stake_thAPT_v2`. In `stake_thAPT_v2`, all users, regardless of whether they are in the FeesExempt whitelist, are charged the staking fee. Thus, it does not account for fee-exempt accounts. 

In `request_unstake_APT`, on the other hand, the fee is calculated only if the user is not in the whitelist.

## Remediation
Update the fee calculation logic in `stake_thAPT_v2` to check for fee exemptions.
