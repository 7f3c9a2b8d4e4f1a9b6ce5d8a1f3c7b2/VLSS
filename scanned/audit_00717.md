## Security Considerations for Juiced Backend Initialization

Although the `initialize` instruction is intended for the Juiced backend, it does not compare the provided backend signer against a fixed public key. If the backend does not initialize all strategies immediately after deployment, an attacker can take control of one. Many admin-gated instructions also fail to perform sufficient account checks. If the backend makes a mistake, this could lead to invalid state.

## Remediation

In the `initialize` instruction, verify that the backend account matches a fixed public key. To simplify testing, this constraint should only apply on mainnet.

Consider incorporating the following (non-comprehensive) list of account checks:

- In the `Initialize` context, `usdc_token` and `mango_program` should be fixed constants on mainnet.
- In the `InitializeMercurial` context, `usdc_token` and `mercurial_program` should be fixed constants on mainnet. Also, `mercurial_lp_token` should be equal to `mercurial_vault.lp_mint`.
- In the `MoveFromMango` and `MoveToMango` contexts, `vault` should be equal to `juiced.usdc_vault_key`.
- In the `SettleSpotFunds` context, `juiced_usdc_vault` should be equal to `juiced.usdc_vault_key`.
- In the `MoveToFromMercurial` context, `juiced_usdc_vault` should be equal to `juiced.usdc_vault_key`.
