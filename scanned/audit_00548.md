## Security Vulnerability: Missing X-Frame-Options Header

The website’s HTTP responses do not include the `X-Frame-Options` security header, which allows attackers to have the website in iframes within a malicious web page and perform clickjacking attacks by forcing the user to click on buttons inside the iframe and perform undesired actions.

## HTTP Response Headers

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Remediation

Add the header `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` in the HTTP response to only allow same-origin iframes. However, if the application is required to be opened by external websites inside iframes, configure the `frame-ancestors` CSP directive.

## Patch

The Mysten Labs team has acknowledged this finding and plans to implement a patch.
