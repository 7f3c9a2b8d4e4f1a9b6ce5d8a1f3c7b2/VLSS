## Validator Management in Protocol Implementation

In the current implementation of the protocol, there is no logic to remove validators from the list of `validator_infos`. It is possible to remove an existing validator, which will just mark it as inactive. The list of active validators may be retrieved utilizing `active_validator_addresses`.

> **Function:**
> ```rust
> fun get_or_add_validator_index_by_staking_pool_id_mut(
> self: &mut Storage,
> system_state: &mut SuiSystemState,
> staking_pool_id: ID,
> ctx: &mut TxContext
> ): u64 {
> [...]
> let validator_address = system_state.validator_address_by_pool_id(&staking_pool_id);
> let exchange_rates = system_state.pool_exchange_rates(&staking_pool_id);
> let latest_exchange_rate = exchange_rates.borrow(ctx.epoch());
> [...]
> }
> ```

Furthermore, the ability to reactivate a validator with a different `staking_pool_id` may introduce complexities. When a validator is reactivated, associating it with a different staking pool may not be straightforward. The existing codebase utilizes `staking_pool_id` as a unique identifier for each validator. Thus, allowing a validator to have multiple associations will result in ambiguity about which `staking_pool_id` should be referenced in various contexts.

## Remediation

Add logic that will keep the validators list updated and ensure that this logic is run at the beginning of each epoch.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `f8b8b00`.
