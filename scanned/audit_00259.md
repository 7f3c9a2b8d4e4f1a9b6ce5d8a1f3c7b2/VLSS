# Missing Fee Tier Calculation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Fee Calculation Mechanism

The fee calculation mechanism, as described in the Deep Book white paper, involves a tiered fee structure for takers based on their stake and trading volume. A specific component of this fee structure, which is the calculation for takers who have staked enough but have not reached the volume threshold, is missing in the implemented code.

The fee calculation for a taker who has staked enough (v >= threshold) but has not reached the volume threshold (v + x < threshold) is defined as:

\[
\text{Fee} = \left( \frac{t}{2} \right) \times (\bar{s} + x - v)
\]

The absence of this calculation results in an inequitable fee distribution, as takers who have met the staking requirement but not the volume threshold are unfairly penalized.

## Remediation

Implement this specific case as described in the white paper.
