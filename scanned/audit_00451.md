## Griefing and DoS Attacks in the Borrow Module

There is a possibility of griefing or denial of service (DoS) attacks in the context of the borrow module. Specifically, the concern is that anyone can perform deposit and repay actions on behalf of an obligation owner since all arguments are shared objects.

Thus, an attacker may deposit a small amount of a specific coin into the obligation of a legitimate user. This may be done by frontrunning or simply executing a deposit transaction on behalf of the user.

```rust
sources/user/borrow.move RUST
fun borrow_internal<T>(
    [...]
): (Balance<T>, Balance<T>) {
    // check if sender is in whitelist
    assert!(
        whitelist::is_address_allowed(market::uid(market), tx_context::sender(ctx)),
        error::whitelist_error()
    );
    [...]
}
```

The obligation now lists this coin as collateral, even if the amount is minuscule and not intended by the legitimate user. Consequently, when the legitimate user attempts to borrow the same coin, the check in `borrow_internal` prevents this action because the coin is already listed as collateral.

## Remediation

Implement stricter access control measures to ensure that only authorized parties can perform deposit and repay actions.
