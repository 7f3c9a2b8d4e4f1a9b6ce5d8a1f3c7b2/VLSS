# State Mutation in View Functions

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
The client provided the following explanation:

> we wanna use the view functions off chain and so it is actually convenient for these to work as they do - we can simulate the changes when calling off chain

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`, `lending_core/sources/lending.move`

**Description:** Some view functions in different modules borrow global structs as mutable and modify their values. This contradicts the expected behavior of a view function.

Although a careful review of the code indicates that none of these state mutations can be abused at the current stage of the protocol, future updates or unknown side effects of these mutations could pose a threat to the protocol's overall security, especially since some of these functions are public.

**Recommendation:** Consider refactoring the code to remove any state mutation logic from view functions.
