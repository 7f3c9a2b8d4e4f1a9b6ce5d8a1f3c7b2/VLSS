## Issues Identified

1. **Redundant Assertions in `protocol_rewards::initialize_module`**

    The function contains redundant assertions for checking the admin’s authorization.

    ```rust
    public fun initialize_module<AssetType>(_admin: &signer) {
        assert!(address_of(_admin) == @merkle, E_NOT_AUTHORIZED);
        if (!exists<ProtocolRewardEvents>(address_of(_admin))) {
            move_to(_admin, ProtocolRewardEvents {
                protocol_revenue_events: new_event_handle<ProtocolRevenueEvent>(_admin)
            });
        };
        assert!(address_of(_admin) == @merkle, E_NOT_AUTHORIZED);
        [...]
    }
    ```

2. **Metadata Storage in `claimable_fa_store`**

    The `ClaimableFaStore` stores the metadata. This may be skipped since it is already included in the `FungibleStore` resource.

3. **Meaningless Constructor in `add_claimable_fa_store`**

    The creation of the `constructor_ref` is meaningless as it is neither utilized to store any resource nor is its `ExtendRef` used anywhere. Moreover, its `DeleteRef` is stored in the `AdminCapability`, which does not make sense.

## Remediation

Remove the above-mentioned redundant/un-utilized code instances.

## Patch

1. Fixed in `906ec95` by removing the redundant assertion.
2. Fixed in `906ec95` by removing the excessive field.
3. Fixed in `906ec95` by also storing the `ExtendRef` in the `AdminCapability`, so the object may be used in future upgrades.
