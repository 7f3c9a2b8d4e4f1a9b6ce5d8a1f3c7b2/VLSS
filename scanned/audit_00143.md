# Unprotected Vercel Preview URLs

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity: Low Risk

## Description
Preview deployments are currently accessible to anyone who obtains the URL, creating unnecessary security exposure. Without deployment protection, preview URLs (e.g., my-preview-5678.vercel.app) are publicly accessible with no access controls or audit capabilities. This presents the following risks:

- Unlimited access to anyone with the preview URL.
- No tracking of preview URL distribution.
- Absence of access audit trails.
- Inability to revoke access selectively.

## Severity Discussion
The impact is low since preview deployments contain pre-release code but not production credentials or data. The likelihood is low as preview URLs are not easily discoverable without internal access. Given the limited exposure and existing deployment controls, this ranks as a low severity issue.

## Recommendation
Enable Vercel Authentication and implement Shareable Links:

1. Enable Vercel Authentication (Standard Protection) to secure all preview deployments.
2. Use Vercel Shareable Links to:
   - Create per-branch preview access links.
   - Control recipient access.
   - Revoke access when needed.
   - Monitor active link usage.
   - Track preview deployment sharing.

This configuration ensures preview deployments remain private by default while maintaining efficient collaboration with external stakeholders through managed access controls.
