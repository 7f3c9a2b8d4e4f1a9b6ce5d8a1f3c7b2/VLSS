# [04] Import of protobuf

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
As per the [docs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.47.x/UPGRADING.md# protobuf);

> The SDK has migrated from gogo/protobuf (which is currently unmaintained), to our own maintained fork, cosmos/gogoproto.
>
> This means you should replace all imports of github.com/gogo/protobuf to github.com/cosmos/gogoproto. This allows you to remove the `>replace directive replace github.com/gogo/protobuf => github.com/regen-network/protobuf v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1` from your `go.mod` file.

While `go.mod` files for minimove imports protobuf as:
```

23:     github.com/cosmos/gogoproto v1.7.0
```

And still has the replace directive:
```

271:     github.com/gogo/protobuf => github.com/regen-network/protobuf v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1
```

The code is actually already using the new recommended import `github.com/cosmos/gogoproto`, which is good. However, the replace directive for `github.com/gogo/protobuf` is still present and should be removed since you’re already using the new import path.

### Recommended mitigation steps

1. Remove the replace directive since you’re already using the correct import.
2. Verify there are no remaining direct imports of `github.com/gogo/protobuf` in the codebase.
3. Keep using `github.com/cosmos/gogoproto` as you currently are.
