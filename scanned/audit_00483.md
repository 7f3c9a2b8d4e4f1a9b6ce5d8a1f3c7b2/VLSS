# Useless Storing Of Boolean

## Code Analysis of pool.move and storage.move

During the execution of `pool.move` and `storage.move`, when performing the `set_owner` and `set_admin` operations for the former and `set_configurator` for the latter, the `val` variable provided as a parameter helps populate the table. However, rather than storing the boolean value as false, it is more advantageous to remove it from the table altogether, as the tables represent the list of owners, admins, and configurators.

## Code Snippet

```rust
source/pool.move RUST

public fun set_owner(pool_admin_cap: &mut PoolAdminCap, owner: u256, val: bool, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(pool_admin_cap.creator == tx_context::sender(ctx), POOL_CALLER_NOT_OWNER);
    if (!table::contains(&pool_admin_cap.owners, owner)) {
        table::add(&mut pool_admin_cap.owners, owner, val)
    } else {
        let v = table::borrow_mut(&mut pool_admin_cap.owners, owner);
        *v = val;
    };
    emit(PoolOwnerSetting {
        sender: tx_context::sender(ctx),
        owner: owner,
        value: val
    });
}
```

## Remediation

Remove the element from the table instead of storing it as false.
