## Code Review Suggestions

1. In `setVaultBankManager`, there is a misspelling in the call to `vaults::set_vaults_bank_manger`. Correct it to `vaults::set_vaults_bank_manager`.
   
2. The `user_active_amount` field is unutilized. Remove it if it is not necessary.

3. Utilize the result of `blake2b256` as the public address, eliminating the necessity for `get_public_address`.

4. The `Vaults` type parameter is currently named `USDC`, suggesting that the type used for the vault is specifically `USDC` (a stable coin). However, this is misleading as there is no enforcement or guarantee in the code that restricts the vault to only work with `USDC`. Rename the type parameter to one more generic.
