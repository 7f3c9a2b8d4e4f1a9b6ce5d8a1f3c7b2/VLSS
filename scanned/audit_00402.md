# Signature Forgery

## Summary
This bug report discusses a vulnerability in the drife_app::request_ride function. The signature used in this function does not have a strict format, allowing an attacker to manipulate the city parameter and potentially obtain a valid signature for any operation. To fix this issue, a pre-defined string should be added to each signature to restrict its use. This bug has been fixed in the latest patch, f19c8e1.

## Details
## Vulnerability Summary

The vulnerability mentioned here is related to the potential misuse of signatures due to the lack of a strict format or predefined structure. In the context of the `drife_app::request_ride`, the signature includes a parameter `city: String` after the address to allow the user to set the city name. However, this string may become any value, even to the operation name.

Thus, if an attacker sets the city parameter to the operation name, they may create a message that appears to be a legitimate request for a ride. However, the user sets the city name to a valid operation requiring an off-chain authority’s authorization to execute. The admin may sign the request without noticing the operation name in the city parameter. This may result in a malicious user obtaining a valid signature for any operation.

## Remediation

Append a predefined string to each signature to restrict them from being utilized in different contexts.

## Patch

Fixed in `f19c8e1`.
