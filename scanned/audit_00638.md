# Centralization Risk

## Message Handling on Aptos

The current implementation uses `fallbackWithdraw` to handle dropped messages on the Aptos side. This is used to prevent messages from blocking the LayerZero pipe on the Aptos side. While acceptable, this pattern exposes a potentially significant attack surface if the operator key was compromised. We’ve seen recent similar compromises with various protocols and thought this was worth raising.

## Remediation

- Ensure proper access control on the operator key.
