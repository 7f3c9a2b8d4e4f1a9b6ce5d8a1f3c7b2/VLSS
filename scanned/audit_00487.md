# Optimizing Computation In Storage

## Reserve Validation in `storage.move`

In `storage.move`, `reserve_validation` prevents the duplication of reserve by iterating through the reserves stored in the Storage object. Each reserve’s `coin_type` is compared with the fixed CoinType name. To optimize computation within the function, the value of the CoinType name may initialize outside the loop as it remains constant throughout the iteration.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun reserve_validation<CoinType>(storage: &Storage) {
    let count = storage.reserves_count;
    let i = 0;
    while (i < count) {
        let reserve = table::borrow(&storage.reserves, i);
        let name = type_name::into_string(type_name::get<CoinType>());
        assert!(reserve.coin_type != name, STORAGE_DUPLICATE_RESERVE);
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
```

## Remediation

Initialize `name` outside the loop.
