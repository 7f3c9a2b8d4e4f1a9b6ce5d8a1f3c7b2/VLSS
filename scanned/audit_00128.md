# Missing Global Pausability (All Pairs) Function for Quicker Reaction in Emergency

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `b521552`. Introduced the `set_all_pairs_paused()` function, which pauses all pools.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** The isolated lending pools, while can be individually paused, lack a global pausability function. Unlike the lending core module which supports global pause flag as well as individualized market paused flag. This may result in losing valuable time in case of a hack, since all pools would have to be iterated and paused individually.

**Recommendation:** We recommend adding a global pausability to the isolated lending pools, to improve reaction time in case of emergencies.
