# [M-02] Native Token Always Deposited to Hardcoded Admin Address

## Summary
This bug report is about a medium risk bug in the `oft_adapter_fa.move` function. The bug causes all native tokens received via `lz_receive_value` to be deposited to the hardcoded `@oft_admin` address instead of the current admin returned by `get_admin()`. This can result in funds being lost after the admin is transferred. The recommended solution is to replace the hardcoded address with a call to `oapp_core::get_admin()`. The team has fixed the bug.

## Details
## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

In `oft_adapter_fa.move`, the credit function deposits all native tokens received via `lz_receive_value` to the hardcoded `@oft_admin` address rather than the current admin returned by `get_admin()`, causing fund leakage after admin transfer.

## Location of Affected Code

In the `oft_adapter_fa::credit()` function, any native tokens sent alongside LayerZero message deliveries are unconditionally deposited to the hardcoded `@oft_admin` address:

File: [sources/oft_implementation/oft_adapter_fa.move#L46](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_BRIDGE/blob/c68e1d39d98b2e819021384771a0bf4722ec5947/sources/oft_implementation/oft_adapter_fa.move#L46)

```rust
public(friend) fun credit(
    to: address,
    amount_ld: u64,
    src_eid: u32,
    lz_receive_value: Option<FungibleAsset>,
): u64 acquires OftImpl {
    // Default implementation does not make special use of LZ Receive Value sent; just deposit to the OFT address
    option::for_each(lz_receive_value, |fa| primary_fungible_store::deposit(@oft_admin, fa));
    // ...
}
```

When the OApp admin changes via `oapp_core::transfer_admin()`, this deposit destination remains unchanged. Any native tokens sent by executors continue accruing to the original admin address rather than the current admin. As a side note, that address is not changeable at all.

Additionally, the `oft_impl_config` module initializes with a hardcoded fee deposit address of `@oft_admin`. If that address is to be changeable, a decision should be made if it should also change `fee_deposit_address` if it was set to a default value.

## Impact

If that address is to be changed, there is no possibility of doing so. If access is lost or should be revoked, then it could possibly results in loss of deposited funds.

## Recommendation

Replace the hardcoded `@oft_admin` with a call to `oapp_core::get_admin()` to deposit to the current admin.

## Team Response

Fixed.
