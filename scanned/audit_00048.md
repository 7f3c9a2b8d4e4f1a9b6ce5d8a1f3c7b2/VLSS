# [L-04] Rewardy Burn Fails if the `from` Address Lacks a Primary Store

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In the `rwd.coin.factory.move`, the `burn()` uses `primary_fungible_store::primary_store()` on `from` address. If `from` never created a primary store, the call reverts even for a zero balance, which is a surprising UX during admin cleanups or forced burns.

It is worth mentioning that the `mint()` path is using `ensure_primary_store_exists()` correctly.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [RWD_APTOS/rwd.coin.factory.move#L136-L142](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_APTOS/blob/76412ed7232407d54c3e2b130eb890188347a010/rwd.coin.factory.move#L136-L142)

```move
public entry fun burn(owner: &signer, from: address, amount: u64) acquires RewardyCoin {
    not_paused();
    let asset = get_metadata();
    let burn_ref = &authorized_borrow_refs(owner, asset).burn_ref;
    let from_wallet = primary_fungible_store::primary_store(from, asset);
    fungible_asset::burn_from(burn_ref, from_wallet, amount);
}
```

## Impact

Admin attempting to burn from a fresh account will see an aborted transaction.

## Recommendation

We recommend using `ensure_primary_store_exists()` or a guarded path that treats “no store” as zero.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.
