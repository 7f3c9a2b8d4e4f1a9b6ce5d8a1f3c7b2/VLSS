# [M-06] LP Redelegation Uses Inaccurate Internal Tracker Amount, Leading to Potential Failures or Orphaned Funds

## Summary
This bug report discusses an issue with the `redelegate_lp` function in the `pool_router` module. This function is used to migrate staked assets from one validator to another, but it has a potential flaw that can cause problems during this process.

The issue is related to the `pool.amount` tracker, which is used to specify the amount of tokens to be redelegated. However, this tracker can become inaccurate due to accrued rewards or slashing events, causing the amount to be incorrect. This can lead to two main problems: redelegation failures and orphaned funds.

The likelihood of this issue occurring is high, as staking rewards are expected to accrue over time. The recommended mitigation steps include modifying the `redelegate_lp` function to query the actual staked amount from the underlying `mstaking` module instead of relying on the tracker.

To demonstrate the potential impact of this bug, two scenarios are presented. In the first scenario, rewards have accrued, increasing the actual staked amount but not updating the tracker. In the second scenario, the validator has been slashed, decreasing the actual staked amount. In both cases, the `change_validator` transaction fails, potentially leaving funds with the old validator or causing the transaction to abort.

### Summary

The `redelegate_lp` function, called during validator changes for LP pools, uses the internal `pool.amount` tracker to specify the amount for `MsgBeginRedelegate`. This tracker can diverge from the actual staked amount due to unreflected rewards or slashing, potentially causing redelegation failures or leaving funds staked with the old validator.

### Finding Description

The `pool_router::change_validator` function allows the deployer (`@staking_addr`) to migrate staked assets managed by a specific `StakePool` object from one validator to another. For LP token pools, it calls the internal helper function `redelegate_lp` located in [pool\_router.move# L327-L339](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-cabal/blob/5b5f92ab4f95e5f9f405bbfa252860472d164705/sources/pool_router.move# L327-L339).

The `redelegate_lp` function constructs a `MsgBeginRedelegate` message to be sent via `cosmos::stargate`. The amount of tokens to be redelegated in this message is taken directly from the `pool.amount` field of the `StakePool` resource:
```

    fun redelegate_lp(pool: &StakePool, new_validator_address: String) {
        let denom = coin::metadata_to_denom(pool.metadata);
        let coin = Coin { denom, amount: pool.amount }; // <<< Uses pool.amount

        let msg = MsgBeginRedelegate {
            // ... other fields ...
            amount: vector[coin] // <<< Amount specified in the message
        };
        cosmos::stargate(&object::generate_signer_for_extending(&pool.ref), marshal(&msg));
    }
```

However, the `pool.amount` is merely an internal counter updated by `pool_router::add_stake` and `pool_router::unstake` and `pool_router::unlock_lp`. It does not automatically reflect changes in the actual staked balance within the underlying `mstaking` module due to:

1. **Accrued Rewards:** Rewards earned by the staked LP tokens increase the actual delegation shares/amount but are not reflected in `pool.amount` until `compound_lp_pool_rewards` runs (triggered by user actions) and subsequently calls `add_stake`.
2. **Slashing**: If the validator is slashed, the actual delegation shares/amount decreases, but `pool.amount` is never updated to reflect this loss.

Therefore, `pool.amount` can easily drift from the true staked amount. Sending a `MsgBeginRedelegate` with this potentially inaccurate amount breaks the expectation that the administrative function correctly manages the entirety of the funds associated with the `StakePool` object.

### Impact

Using an inaccurate amount in `MsgBeginRedelegate` leads to two primary negative outcomes:

1. **Redelegation Failure**:If `pool.amount` is greater than the actual staked amount (e.g., due to slashing), the underlying `mstaking` module will reject the request, causing the `cosmos::stargate` call and the entire `change_validator` transaction to abort. This prevents the deployer from migrating funds away from a potentially slashed or undesirable validator.
2. **Partial Redelegation / Orphaned Funds:** If `pool.amount` is less than the actual staked amount (e.g., due to accrued rewards not yet reflected), the `mstaking` module will likely succeed in redelegating only the specified `pool.amount`. The remaining tokens (the difference) will be left staked with the original validator. However, the `change_validator` function proceeds to update `pool.validator` to the new address. This creates an inconsistent state where the `StakePool` object points to the new validator, but some funds remain with the old one, potentially becoming difficult to track, manage, or withdraw through the router’s standard logic.

### Likelihood

The likelihood of `pool.amount` becoming inaccurate is **High**. Staking rewards are expected to accrue over time. If users don’t frequently stake or unstake from a specific LP pool, the `compound_lp_pool_rewards` function won’t run often, causing `pool.amount` to lag behind the actual staked amount (actual > tracker). Slashing events, while less frequent, would cause the tracker to exceed the actual amount.

Therefore, drift between `pool.amount` and the real staked value is highly likely. The likelihood of this drift causing a problem during a `change_validator` call is **Medium**, as it depends on when the deployer chooses to execute this administrative action relative to the drift.

### Recommended mitigation steps

Modify the `redelegate_lp` function to query the actual delegation amount from the underlying `mstaking` module before constructing the `MsgBeginRedelegate` message. This can be done using a `query_stargate` call similar to the one used in `get_lp_real_stakes`. Use this queried, accurate amount instead of `pool.amount`.

Apply the following conceptual change (exact query path and response parsing might need adjustment based on Initia’s `mstaking` module specifics) to [pool\_router.move# L327-L339](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-cabal/blob/5b5f92ab4f95e5f9f405bbfa252860472d164705/sources/pool_router.move# L327-L339):
```

     fun redelegate_lp(pool: &StakePool, new_validator_address: String) {
         let denom = coin::metadata_to_denom(pool.metadata);
-        let coin = Coin { denom, amount: pool.amount };
+        let pool_addr = object::address_from_extend_ref(&pool.ref);

+        // Query the actual staked amount instead of relying on the internal tracker
+        let path = b"/initia.mstaking.v1.Query/Delegation"; // Adjust path if needed
+        let request = DelegationRequest { validator_addr: pool.validator, delegator_addr: address::to_sdk(pool_addr) };
+        let response_bytes = query_stargate(path, marshal(&request));
+        // Note: Need robust parsing and error handling for the query response here.
+        // Assuming successful query and parsing to get the actual_staked_amount:
+        let actual_staked_amount = parse_delegation_response_amount(response_bytes, denom); // Placeholder for parsing logic
+        assert!(actual_staked_amount > 0, error::invalid_state(0)); // Add appropriate error code
+
+        let coin = Coin { denom, amount: actual_staked_amount }; // Use the queried amount
         let msg = MsgBeginRedelegate {
             _type_: string::utf8(b"/initia.mstaking.v1.MsgBeginRedelegate"),
             delegator_address: to_sdk(object::address_from_extend_ref(&pool.ref)),
```

(Note: The `parse_delegation_response_amount` function is illustrative; the actual implementation would involve using `unmarshal` and navigating the `DelegationResponse` struct as done in `get_lp_real_stakes` to extract the correct amount for the given denom.)

### Proof of Concept

1. **Setup:** Configure an LP pool using `add_pool`. Stake some LP tokens via `cabal::stake_asset` (which calls `pool_router::add_stake`), setting `pool.amount` to, say, 1,000,000.
2. **Scenario 1 (Rewards Accrued):** Assume rewards accrue in the underlying `mstaking` module, increasing the actual staked amount to 1,050,000, but no user actions trigger compounding, so `pool.amount` remains 1,000,000.
3. **Action:** The deployer calls `change_validator` for this pool. `redelegate_lp` is called.
4. **Execution:** `redelegate_lp` constructs `MsgBeginRedelegate` with `amount = 1,000,000`.
5. **Outcome:** The `mstaking` module successfully redelegates 1,000,000 tokens. 50,000 tokens remain staked with the old validator. `change_validator` updates `pool.validator` to the new address. The 50,000 tokens are now potentially orphaned from the router’s perspective.
6. **Scenario 2 (Slashing Occurred):** Assume the validator was slashed, reducing the actual staked amount to 950,000, but `pool.amount` remains 1,000,000.
7. **Action:** The deployer calls `change_validator`. `redelegate_lp` is called.
8. **Execution:** `reredelegate_lp` constructs `MsgBeginRedelegate` with `amount = 1,000,000`.
9. **Outcome:** The `mstaking` module rejects the request because only 950,000 tokens are available. The `cosmos::stargate` call fails, causing the `change_validator` transaction to abort. The validator cannot be changed.
