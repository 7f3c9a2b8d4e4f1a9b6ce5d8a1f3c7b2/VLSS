# Limit Bypass Through Stake Coins Invocation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Stake Router Overview

The `stake_router` provides two entry points to stake coins:

- **`stake_router::stake_coins`**  
  A permissionless staking endpoint. Takes in `Coin<AptosCoin>` and returns `Coin<StakedAptosCoin>`.

- **`stake_router::stake`**  
  A wrapper over `stake_coins`. Withdraws coins from the signer, verifies a minimum deposit limit, invokes `stake_coins`, and emits a `StakeEvent`.

Currently, there exists a minimum stake requirement imposed in `stake`:

```move
tortuga/sources/stake_router.move MOVE
public entry fun stake(
    delegator: &signer,
    amount: u64
) ... {
    ...
    assert!(
        amount >= staking_status.min_transaction_amount,
        error::invalid_argument(EAMOUNT_TOO_SMALL)
    );
    ...
}
```

However, users may invoke `stake_coins` directly to bypass this limit.

## Patch

Fixed in `2b336d6` by making `stake_coins` private.
