## Issues Identified

1. **Counter Quote Index Validation**
   - The `counter_quote_index` provided as an argument to `choose_ride` should be valid and correspond to an existing counterquote in the `ride.counter_quotes` vector. If this index is out of bounds, it will result in accessing memory that does not belong to the vector, leading to an out of bounds error.

2. **Percent Vector Length**
   - In the `CounterQuote` structure, verify that `percent: vector<u8>` is the correct length.

## Remediation Steps

1. Include a check to ensure that `counter_quote_index` is within the bounds of the `ride.counter_quotes` vector.
2. Validate the length of `percent: vector<u8>`.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `a7f969f`.
