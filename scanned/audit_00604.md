# Edge Case In Auction Price Calculation

## Auction Status and Price Calculation

## Overview

The `status` function returns a boolean, which determines if the auction requires a reset, along with the current auction price. 

## Edge Case Explanation

With `DEFAULT_RESERVE_RATIO_BPS` being zero, in an edge case where the `elapsed_time` equals `expiry_time_seconds`, the calculated `price` and `decrease_ratio` will be zero while `below_reserve` will be false since `0 < 0` evaluates to false. 

Since a denominator in a formula used in bid relies on the returned auction price, a division by zero error will occur, leading to an abort. This may present a critical issue if bidding is completed successfully with an auction price of zero.

## Remediation

Change the condition in the `if` statement in `status` from:

```plaintext
(elapsed_seconds > params.expiry_time_seconds)
```

to:

```plaintext
(elapsed_seconds >= params.expiry_time_seconds)
```

## Patch

Fixed in #120.
