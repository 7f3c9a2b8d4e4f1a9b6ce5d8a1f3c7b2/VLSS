Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> For on-chain users, they are capable of and should understand that vault_id is the unique identifier. For DAPP users, in addition to displaying vault_id, we will also present key information such as vault creation time, TVL, and performance, and can also issue warnings about similar vault names.

**File(s) affected:**`vault.move`

**Description:** The `create_vault()` function allows vault creators to provide a name for their vaults in string format. However, this string is not sanitized or validated. This can lead to situations where multiple vaults exist with visually similar names that differ only in capitalization or whitespace, such as `TestVault`, `TestVault`, or `test vault`.

**Recommendation:** Consider sanitizing vault names by:

1.   Ensuring the names are alphanumeric and only allow a defined set of special characters.
2.   Trimming whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.
3.   Converting all characters to either uppercase or lowercase, if appropriate.
