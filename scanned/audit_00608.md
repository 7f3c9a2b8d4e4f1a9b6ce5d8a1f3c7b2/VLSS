# Using Creator Address As Key For LBPCollection

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## LBP Collection Documentation

The launch module stores a list of LBP instances in the `LBPCollection<Asset0, Asset1>` resource using `sha3(asset_0_name + asset_1_name + creator_address)` as the key and LBP as the value.

However, since an `LBPCollection` has unique asset generics for each asset pair, calculating the hash with asset names is unnecessary. Instead, the creator’s address may function as the key for the LBP instances.

## Remediation
Use the creator address as the key for LBPs in `LBPCollection` and rewrite all functions that use the LBP collection.

## Patch
Fixed in `f4fb228`.
