## Redundancy Issue in `execute_admin_operation` Implementation

The current implementation of `execute_admin_operation` in `maven.move` contains a redundancy issue. The first while loop stores approved operations in the `operations` vector, while the second loop iterates over the same vector again. This results in an unnecessary iteration and may be optimized to improve efficiency and reduce gas usage.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public entry fun execute_admin_operation(
    global_pause: &Pause,
    maven: &mut Maven,
    sys_clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    // Check all permissions
    let approved_set = vec_set::empty<PermissionID>();
    let i = 0;
    while (i < op_count) {
        // ...
    };
    
    // Execute all operations
    let i = 0;
    while (i < op_count) {
        // ...
    };
}
```

## Remediation

Remove the second loop and execute the approved operations directly in the first loop.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `06f947c`.
