# Minimum Limit On Staking

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Using MIN_COINS_ON_SHARES_POOL

Using `MIN_COINS_ON_SHARES_POOL` while staking and unlocking may be quite stringent. A more effective approach would be to deposit the required amount during the initialization phase. This would eliminate the need to constantly ensure that the pool maintains a sufficient stake, thereby simplifying the process and reducing potential complications. 

## Remediation

Deposit the required amount during the initialization phase to eliminate the need to constantly ensure that the pool maintains a sufficient stake. 

## Patch
