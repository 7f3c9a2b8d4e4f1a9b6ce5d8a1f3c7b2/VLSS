**Update**
Addressed in: `080e441`. Introduced staleness check in `get_price_by_metadata()`.

**File(s) affected:**`echelon_oracle/sources/oracle.move`

**Description:** The `echelon_oracle::oracle::get_price_by_metadata` function is a view function that retrieves the current price of an asset from the oracles and returns it. However, unlike other functions such as `get_and_update_price_by_metadata`, it does not ensure that the returned price is not stale.

**Recommendation:** Consider verifying the `updated_at` timestamp of the oracle's returned value against the difference between `max_staleness_seconds` and the current time to ensure the price is not stale.
