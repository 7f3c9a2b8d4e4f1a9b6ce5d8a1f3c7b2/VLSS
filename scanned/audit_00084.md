# Inline small internal functions only used once

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Description:** It is more gas efficient to inline small internal functions only used once.

For example `pUSDeDepositor::getPhase` is only called by `deposit_sUSDe`. Changing `deposit_sUSDe` to cache `pUSDe` then use the cached copy in the call to `PreDepositPhaser::currentPhase` saves 1 storage read in addition to saving the function call overhead.

**Strata:** Fixed in commit [9398379](https://github.com/Strata-Money/contracts/commit/93983791adbd45a555d947a12a5a6fd9bbfe7330).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.
