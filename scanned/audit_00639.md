# Tighter Type Validation

## uints::get_number

The `uints::get_number` function could enforce that the UID type passed in is owned by the correct module and starts with "U". This could mitigate type confusion issues down the line.

```rust
sources/uints.move
```

```rust
public fun get_number<UID>(): u64 {
    let struct_name = struct_name(&type_of<UID>());
    let len = length(&struct_name);
    let result: u64 = 0;
    let idx = 1; // Skip "U"
    while (idx < len) {
        result = 10 * result;
        let number = *borrow(&struct_name, idx) - 48;
        result = result + (number as u64);
        idx = idx + 1;
    };
    result
}
```

## Remediation

Check that the UID type is owned by the correct module and perform a sanity check on the type name format.
