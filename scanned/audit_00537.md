# Lack Of Checks For Init Function In Verifier

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Sui Verifier

In `sui-verifier`, `verify_init_function` checks the correctness of `init` before the deployment. However, this function does not guarantee the presence of the entry modifier.

## Remediation

Add the correct check to ensure that the `init` function is not an entry function.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `5ae2698`.
