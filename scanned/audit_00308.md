# Limitless Allocations

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Allocation Model Analysis

The allocation model in the protocol used for reward distribution appears weak. While not a security vulnerability due to the centralized nature of these functions, it should be confirmed that these are intentional design choices.

## Examples:
1. A user may transfer TruAPT coins even after allocation.
2. A user may allocate the maximum withdrawal amount of APT multiple times, enabling users to excessively increase the allocated amount for a user, and in turn increase the total allocated amount.
3. A user may deallocate at any time without distributing rewards.

It is crucial to determine if these behaviors fall within the scope of the protocol’s design or if they represent oversights that need to be addressed.

## Remediation
Lock the amount of truAPT that is allocated so that it may not be transferred out of the account before distribution.

## Patch
Acknowledged by the development team.
