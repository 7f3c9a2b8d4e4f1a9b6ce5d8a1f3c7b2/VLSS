## Issue Report: Validation of Relationship in `create_lst_with_stake`

Currently, the `create_lst_with_stake` function does not validate the relationship between the SUI, `fungible_staked_sui`, and `lst_treasury_cap.total_supply` values. The function only ensures that `lst_treasury_cap.total_supply` and the total staked SUI in the system are greater than zero.

```rust
// contracts/sources/liquid_staking.move
public fun create_lst_with_stake<P: drop>(
    system_state: &mut SuiSystemState,
    fee_config: FeeConfig,
    lst_treasury_cap: TreasuryCap<P>,
    mut fungible_staked_suis: vector<FungibleStakedSui>,
    sui: Coin<SUI>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) -> (AdminCap<P>, LiquidStakingInfo<P>) {
    [...]
    vector::destroy_empty(fungible_staked_suis);
    storage.join_to_sui_pool(sui.into_balance());
    assert!(lst_treasury_cap.total_supply() > 0 && storage.total_sui_supply() > 0,
            EInvalidLstCreation);
    
    create_lst_with_storage(
        fee_config,
        lst_treasury_cap,
        storage,
        ctx
    )
}
```

The LST created should ideally represent a proportional claim on the underlying staked SUI assets. If there is no relationship between the total LST supply and the staked SUI, users may receive LST tokens that over- or under-represent the actual value of the staked assets. The misalignment between LST and staked SUI may result in incorrect pricing when users interact with the liquid staking system.

## Remediation

Implement a check that will validate whether the amounts are reasonable.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `288ce2a`.
