# [Initia] Removal of Accrual Functions Before Protocol Changes Leading to Interest Distortion

## Summary
The bug report discusses an issue with the functions used to calculate interest in the `isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move` file. These functions, `set_interest_fee_bps()` and `set_pair_jump_interest_rate_model()`, were previously used to accrue interest before changing protocol parameters. However, they have since been removed, which can result in distorted interest calculations and unexpected changes in interest rates. The report recommends adding back the accrual functions to ensure a fair protocol behavior.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `f43ade3`. The recommended accrual function calls are added.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** The following functions used to accrue interest before changing protocol parameters. This ensure that up to the point of the changes all interest would be accumulated as per the previous configuration.

1.   `set_interest_fee_bps()`.
2.   `set_pair_jump_interest_rate_model()`.

Removing the accrual functions would lead to distorted interests as pending interest accrual would assume the new values, which could lead to sudden unexpectedly high or low interest changes.

**Recommendation:** We recommend adding back the accrual functions to ensure a more fair protocol behavior.
