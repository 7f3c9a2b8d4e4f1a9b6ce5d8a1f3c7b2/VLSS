## Security Awareness Training Recommendation for Thala

## Severity: Low Risk

### Description
Thala would benefit from implementing structured security awareness training. While technical security measures are in place, the human element requires strengthening through targeted education, particularly given the increasing sophistication of attacks targeting DeFi protocols.

### Recommendation
- Consider implementing KnowBe4's security training platform ([knowbe4.com](https://knowbe4.com)) to establish baseline security awareness and conduct regular phishing simulations. Their small-team pricing options and crypto-specific scenarios make this a practical choice for Thala's size and needs.
- The Red Guild's Phishing Dojo ([phishing.rektgames.xyz](https://phishing.rektgames.xyz)) offers free, interactive training specifically designed for crypto teams. This can complement KnowBe4 by providing hands-on practice with signature verification, transaction analysis, and scam site identification.
- Additionally, schedule monthly team security sessions to discuss "The Art of Social Engineering" concepts and rotate security topic presentations among team members.

### Implementation Plan
Given the small team size:
- Assign a security champion role.
- Use a simple spreadsheet for tracking.
- Integrate training into existing team meetings.
- Focus on high-impact, low-friction activities.
