## Round Data Access Control Issue

The public getter functions which return round data should abort if the value `aggregator::limit_reads_to_whitelist` is set to true. In the function `aggregator::latest_round`, there was no check to limit the users even if the value is set to true.

## Code Snippet

```rust
sources/schemas/aggregator.move

public fun latest_round(addr: address): ([..]) acquires AggregatorRound, AggregatorReadConfig {
    let aggregator = borrow_global_mut<AggregatorReadConfig>(addr);
    assert!(aggregator.read_charge == 0, errors::PermissionDenied());
    [..]
}
```

This would allow anyone to read the data of the last round when the `read_charge` is 0, regardless of whether it is allowed to read or not.

## Remediation

Add a check to ensure the value `limit_reads_to_whitelist` is set to false.

```rust
assert!(
    aggregator_read_config.read_charge == 0 &&
    !aggregator_read_config.limit_reads_to_whitelist,
    errors::PermissionDenied()
);
```
