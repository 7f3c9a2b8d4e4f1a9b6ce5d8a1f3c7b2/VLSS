# Lack of Deadline Protection for Withdrawal Requests

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> The system operator is an automated processing program. Once detecting a request_withdraw event, it will immediately process the positions and then execute fill_withdrawal_requests. The system operator has no interests or incentives to block or delay the processing of users' withdrawal requests. In the current system, users need to trust the system operator, and we will add corresponding explanations in the operation interface and documentation.

**File(s) affected:**`vault.move`

**Description:** The `request_withdraw()` function allows users to queue a withdrawal, but it does not allow them to specify a deadline, which causes the request to remain valid indefinitely.

This creates a “hostage” situation where a user requests to withdraw at a certain price, but the operator (or creator) can delay execution until the share price drops. The user has no way to cancel the request or enforce a minimum acceptable price.

**Recommendation:** Add a `deadline` parameter to `request_withdraw()`. In `fill_withdrawal_requests()`, check if conditions are met and refund the user if not.
