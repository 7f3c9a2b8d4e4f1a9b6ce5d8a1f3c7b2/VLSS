# Incorrectly Calculated Reward Period

## Summary
The bug is in the function "accumulate_strategys_reward" and "accumulate_strategy_reward" where the last_reward_time is not updated if the emission_per_second is set to zero. This results in an incorrect calculation of rewards when the emission rate is set to a positive value after being zero for a period of time. To fix this, the last_reward_time should be updated in both functions regardless of the current emission_per_second value. This issue has been resolved in the patch 971cfd9.

## Details
## Accumulate Strategy's Reward

The `accumulate_strategy_reward` function updates the `last_reward_time` if the `emission_per_second` is greater than zero. Thus, if the emission rate is set to zero for a period of time and then set to a positive value, the reward calculations will include the time elapsed during the zero-emission period.

> _rewarder.move_reward_

```rust
public(friend) fun accumulate_strategys_reward<T>(manager: &mut RewarderManager, current_time: u64) {
    // Obtain a mutable reference to the specific rewarder by its type.
    let type_name = type_name::get<T>();
    let rewarder = linked_table::borrow_mut<TypeName, Rewarder>(&mut manager.rewarders, type_name);
    if (rewarder.emission_per_second == 0) {
        return;
    };
    [...]
}
```

Since `last_reward_time` is used to calculate the elapsed time for reward accumulation, including a period with zero emissions will result in an over-calculation of the rewards earned by strategies during that time.

## Remediation

Update `last_reward_time` in both functions regardless of the current `emission_per_second` value. This ensures that the reward calculations always consider the total elapsed time, even during periods with zero emission.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `971cfd9`.
