# Implementing Set Switchboard Config Function

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Oracle Module Overview

The oracle module utilizes the Switchboard oracle to obtain coin prices. The aggregator address for a specific coin type is stored in the `SwitchboardConfig<CoinType>` structure and set during the initialization process of the oracle for that coin. 

However, once the oracle is initialized, the manager is unable to update the aggregator configuration for a given coin.

## Remediation

Implement a `set_switchboard_config` function to enable the manager to update the aggregator address for a coin.

## Patch

Fixed in `0e805a2` by implementing a `configure_switchboard` function.
