## Unnecessary Signing and Seed Usage

There is unnecessary signing and seed usage in certain `token::transfer` and `burn_nft` function calls. Specifically, in `deposit`, calls to `token::transfer` do not require seeds or a signed invocation. In `Withdraw`, there is a call to `burn_nft`, which also does not require a signed invocation—resulting in unnecessary signing and seed usage affecting the code’s efficiency.

## Remediation

Modify `token::transfer` and `burn_nft` to handle both signed and unsigned invocations. This may be achieved by introducing a boolean argument or checking the seeds’ length.
