# Version Assertion

## Summary

## Details
## Contract Version Validation

`assert_version` validates the contract version. The most secure approach is to permit the utilization of solely the newest contract version. Nevertheless, the current implementation allows for the utilization of both the newest and the previous contract versions.

## Code Snippet

```rust
native_pool.move RUST
fun assert_version(self: &NativePool) {
    assert!(self.version == VERSION - 1 || self.version == VERSION,
    E_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION);
}
```

## Remediation

Eliminate the `self.version == VERSION - 1` condition from the function.

## Patch

The Volo team has confirmed that this behavior is intentional. If there is a need to disable the previous version, the team will increase it utilizing `VERSION += 2`.
