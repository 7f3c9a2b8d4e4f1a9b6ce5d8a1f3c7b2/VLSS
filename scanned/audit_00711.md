## DAO Storage Withdraw Event Correction

The function `dao_storage::withdraw` emits an incorrect event type, `CoinDepositedEvent`, when the withdraw functionality is completed.

## Remediation

Change the event handle to `coin_withdrawn_handle` and the event type to `CoinWithdrawnEvent`.

```plaintext
sources/swap/dao_storage.move
event::emit_event(
+ &mut events_store.coin_withdrawn_handle,
+ CoinWithdrawnEvent<X, Y, LP>{ x_val, y_val }
);
```

## Patch

Issue resolved in `637ad72` by replacing the `CoinDepositedEvent` event type with `CoinWithdrawnEvent` and the handle `coin_deposited_handle` with the proper `coin_withdrawn_handle`.
