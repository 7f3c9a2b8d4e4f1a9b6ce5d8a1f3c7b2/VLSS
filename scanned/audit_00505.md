# Configurable Simple Oracle Updater

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Oracle Module Overview

The oracle module employs a straightforward oracle that saves the price of a coin in a resource. The price of a coin, frequently updated by a protocol bot, may be utilized as a backup in the event of a failure of the Pyth or Switchboard oracles.

## Resource Updater

The resource updater, responsible for updating the coin price in the resource, is statically set in the move configuration file and is fixed at compile time.

## Remediation

Implement a configurable simple oracle updater address instead. The manager will then be able to update the address in the case of losing the updater private key.

## Patch

Fixed in `778e6ee` by implementing `configure_simple_oracle`.
