# Improper Implementation Of Mint Cap Check

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Mint Cap Limitation in MOD Token Minting

The `mint_cap` parameter set by the protocol limits the number of mintable MOD tokens. The limit is checked by confirming that the newly minted amount alongside the previous total debt does not exceed the `mint_cap`.

However, in implementation, the amount considered in this check (`amount`) does not match the amount actually minted (`total_amount = amount + fee_amount`). Hence, this leads to the minting of MOD exceeding the amount set in the `mint_cap` parameter.

## Remediation

Use the amount actually minted while enforcing the `mint_cap` constraint.

## Patch

Fixed in `baa84d1` by using the same amount while checking the `mint_cap` constraint and minting MOD.
