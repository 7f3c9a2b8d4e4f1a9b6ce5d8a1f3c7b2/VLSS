## Security Implications of Public Functions in `registry.move`

The public functions in `registry.move` may lead to serious security issues if an attacker obtains a mutable reference to any instance of `registry::Registry`. In the current implementation, this threat is mitigated, as an attacker is unable to mutably borrow the original Registry stored as a dynamic field, nor create a new one independently. However, an unintentional future change to the registry module may inadvertently allow this to happen, potentially introducing a critical vulnerability.

## Function `add_record`

```rust
/// Attempts to add a new record to the registry and returns a
/// `RegistrationNFT` upon success.
public fun add_record(
    self: &mut Registry,
    domain: Domain,
    no_years: u8,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): RegistrationNFT {
    // ...
}
```

`add_record` should not be successfully invoked from an untrusted module. Therefore, adding the friend visibility modifier has no drawbacks.

## Remediation

Change the visibility of all public functions that accept `&mut Registry` as an argument to `friend`.
