## Increase Oracle Length

The `increase_oracle_length` function in Oracle is utilized to incorporate new sample slots into the oracle. It may be accessed by anyone, which might result in unnecessary addition of samples, causing the predefined maximum length (`MAX_ORACLE_LENGTH`) to be reached and also leading to resource exhaustion.

## Function Definition

```move
sources/oracle.move MOVE
/// Add new sample slots to oracle.
public fun increase_oracle_length<X, Y, BinStep>(samples_to_add: u64) acquires Oracle {
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Ensure that this situation is either by design or, if unintended, implement appropriate access control measures to safeguard this functionality.
