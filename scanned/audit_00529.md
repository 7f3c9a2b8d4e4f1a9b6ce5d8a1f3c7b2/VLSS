## Cookie Vulnerability Explanation

The `getCookie` function first URL decodes the `document.cookie` attribute and then searches for the cookie by its name. This allows attackers to inject cookies by sending a cookie value with a URL encoded `;` sign. This may be achieved when setting the referral cookie since its value may be attacker-controlled once it is obtained from a query parameter.

## JavaScript Implementation of getCookie

```javascript
export const getCookie = (cname) => {
    let name = cname + '=';
    let decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
    let ca = decodedCookie.split(';');
    for (let i = 0; i < ca.length; i++) {
        let c = ca[i];
        while (c.charAt(0) === ' ') {
            c = c.substring(1);
        }
        if (c.indexOf(name) === 0) {
            return c.substring(name.length, c.length);
        }
    }
    return '';
};
```

Additionally, `setCookie` receives the cookie name and cookie value as parameters and sets the cookie with `document.cookie =`. However, an arbitrary cookie value may include a `;` sign and inject cookie attributes such as `SameSite`, `domain`, and `path`.

## JavaScript Implementation of setCookie

```javascript
export const setCookie = (cname, cvalue, exdays) => {
    const d = new Date();
    d.setTime(d.getTime() + exdays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    let expires = 'expires=' + d.toUTCString();
    document.cookie = `${cname}=${cvalue};${expires};path=/`;
};
```

## Remediation

- URL decode the cookie’s value after finding it by its name.
- Also, URL encode the cookie name and the cookie value before adding it to the website via `document.cookie`.
