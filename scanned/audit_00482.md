# Unused Reserves List

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Storage Object in storage.move

In `storage.move`, the `Storage` object contains `reserves_list` as a field representing a vector of reserve indexes. However, this field is removable since there are no delegations of reserve in the storage, and the vector may be derived using `reserves_count`.

## Source Code
```rust
struct Storage has key, store {
    // Use as index
    id: UID,
    // The creator of the pool
    owner: address,
    // Whether the pool is paused
    paused: bool,
    // Reserve list. index -> reserve data
    reserves: Table<u8, ReserveData>,
    // List of reserve indexes
    reserves_list: vector<u8>,
    // Administrator of the protocol
    configurator: Table<address, bool>,
    // Total reserves count
    reserves_count: u8,
    users: vector<address>,
    user_info: Table<address, UserInfo>
}
```

## Remediation
Remove the `reserves_list` field from the `Storage` object.
