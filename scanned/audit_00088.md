# [M-05] Last Holder Can’t Exit, Zero‑Supply Unstake Reverts

## Summary
This bug report is about a problem that occurs when a user tries to burn all of the remaining supply of a Cabal LST (a type of token) using a specific function called `initiate_unstake`. The issue is that when this happens, the next step in the process always fails due to a divide-by-zero error. This means that the user is unable to exit the system and their funds are permanently locked. This can also cause a denial of service for other users. The report recommends a fix to prevent this error from happening and provides a proof of concept to demonstrate the issue.

### Finding description and impact

When a user burns the **entire remaining supply** of a Cabal LST ( sxINIT or Cabal LPT) via `initiate_unstake`, the follow‑up processing step always aborts with a divide‑by‑zero and the user can never exit.

1. **User calls `initiate_unstake(stake_type, S)` – S equals the whole supply.**
2. `unstake_xinit` / `unstake_lp` queues `process_*_unstake` with `cosmos::move_execute( … "process_xinit_unstake" | "process_lp_unstake" … )` for next transaction.
3. **After queuing**, `initiate_unstake` burns the LST: `cabal_token::burn(S)` ⇒ live supply becomes **0**.
4. Transaction 1 finishes and state now shows `supply = 0`, `pending[i] = S`.
5. **Later, Transaction 2 executes `process_*_unstake`.**
6. Calls `compound_*_pool_rewards` (does not change LST supply).
7. Reads the current LST supply: `sx_supply = fungible_asset::supply(meta)` ⇒ **0**.
8. Calculates `ratio = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(unstake_amount, sx_supply)` which triggers `assert!(denominator != 0)` → **`EDIVISION_BY_ZERO` abort**.

Because the burn happened in a prior committed transaction, every retry of `process_*_unstake` gets the same `supply == 0` state and fails again, so the user’s INIT / LP is permanently locked and it makes a DoS for the final staker of that pool.
```

    // Simplified logic from process_xinit_unstake
    entry fun process_xinit_unstake(account: &signer, staker_addr: address, unstaking_type: u64, unstake_amount: u64) acquires ModuleStore, CabalStore, LockExempt {
        // ... permission checks, reward compounding ...
        let m_store = borrow_global_mut<ModuleStore>(@staking_addr);
        let x_init_amount = m_store.staked_amounts[unstaking_type];

        // --- VULNERABILITY ---
        // 'unstake_amount' is the original amount burned (== total supply in this case).
        // 'sx_init_amount' reads the supply *after* the burn in initiate_unstake, so it's 0.
        let sx_init_amount = option::extract(&mut fungible_asset::supply(m_store.cabal_stake_token_metadata[unstaking_type])); // Returns 0

        // This attempts bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(S, 0) --> Division by Zero!
        let ratio = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(unstake_amount as u128, sx_init_amount);
        // Transaction reverts here.
        // ... rest of function is unreachable ...
    }
```

**Impact:**

If an address burns the last sxINIT / LPT in circulation, every call to `process_*_unstake` reverts with `EDIVISION_BY_ZERO`, so no `UnbondingEntry` is recorded and the underlying INIT / LP can never be claimed. The final staker’s funds are permanently locked and causes a pool‑level denial of service.

### Recommended mitigation steps

In `process_xinit_unstake` and `process_lp_unstake`:
```

let pool_before = m_store.staked_amounts[pool];
let supply      = fungible_asset::supply(meta);

let unbond = if supply == 0 {
    // last holder – give them the entire pool
    pool_before
} else {
    let r = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(unstake_amount, supply);
    bigdecimal::mul_by_u64_truncate(r, pool_before)
};
```

* Guard against `supply == 0`.
* If it’s the final unstake, transfer the whole remaining pool; otherwise keep the original ratio logic.

### Proof of Concept
```

// Assume pool index 1 is an LP‑staking pool
let pool_idx: u64 = 1;

// ── step 1: mint exactly 1 Cabal‑LPT to Alice ───────────────────────────
let mint_cap = &ModuleStore.cabal_stake_token_caps[pool_idx].mint_cap;
cabal_token::mint_to(mint_cap, @alice, 1);          // total supply = 1

// ── step 2: Alice initiates unstake of the ENTIRE supply ────────────────
cabal::initiate_unstake(&signer(@alice), pool_idx, 1);
/*
 * inside initiate_unstake:
 *   • cabal_token::burn(1)            → total supply becomes 0
 *   • schedules process_lp_unstake()  (async)
 */

// ── step 3: worker executes queued call ──────────────────────────────────
cabal::process_lp_unstake(&assets_signer, @alice, pool_idx, 1);
/*
 * inside process_lp_unstake:
 *
 *   let sx_supply = fungible_asset::supply(lp_metadata);   // == 0
 *   let ratio     = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(1, sx_supply);
 *                         └────── divide‑by‑zero → abort
 *
 * transaction reverts with EZeroDenominator
 */
```
