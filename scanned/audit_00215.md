# Investor Limit Calculation Error

## Summary
The bug report states that the U.S. investors' limit is not being calculated correctly. This limit is meant to restrict the percentage of U.S. investors compared to the total number of investors. However, the current calculation does not take into account the maximum percentage of U.S. investors that should be allowed. This means that the actual number of U.S. investors may exceed the intended limit. The suggested solution is to use a new calculation that includes both the U.S. investors' limit and the maximum percentage of U.S. investors. This bug has been fixed in version #61.

## Details
## U.S. Investors' Limit

`max_us_investors_percentage` is not considered when calculating the U.S. investors’ limit. The U.S. investors’ limit is intended to restrict the percentage of U.S. investors relative to the total number of investors. Not incorporating the `max_us_investors_percentage` implies that the actual cap on U.S. investors may exceed the intended compliance threshold.

## Remediation

Calculate the limit as shown below:

```
Actual Limit = min(us_investors_limit, max_us_investors_percentage × total_investors / 100)
```

Apply this logic if both `us_investors_limit` and `max_us_investors_percentage` are non-zero.

## Patch

Resolved in #61.
