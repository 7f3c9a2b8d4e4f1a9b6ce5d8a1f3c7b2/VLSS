## Documentation for `swap_in_pool` Function

In `pool::swap_in_pool`, for a swap from `CoinTypeA` to `CoinTypeB` (`a2b` is true), the current square root price of the pool must be greater than `sqrt_price_max_limit`, and `sqrt_price_max_limit` must be greater than or equal to the minimum square root price. For a swap from `CoinTypeB` to `CoinTypeA` (`a2b` is false), the current square root price must be less than `sqrt_price_max_limit`, and `sqrt_price_max_limit` must be less than or equal to the maximum square root price.

```rust
fun swap_in_pool<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB>(
    clock: &Clock,
    pool: &mut Pool<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB>,
    a2b: bool,
    by_amount_in: bool,
    amount: u64,
    sqrt_price_max_limit: u128
): SwapResult {
    [...]
    if (a2b) {
        assert!(pool.current_sqrt_price > sqrt_price_max_limit && sqrt_price_max_limit >= tick_math::min_sqrt_price(), errors::invalid_price_limit());
    } else {
        assert!(pool.current_sqrt_price < sqrt_price_max_limit && sqrt_price_max_limit <= tick_math::max_sqrt_price(), errors::invalid_price_limit());
    };
    [...]
}
```

However, if the current tick is at `MIN_TICK` (the lowest price in the pool), then the condition `sqrt_price_max_limit >= min_sqrt_price` will still pass if `sqrt_price_max_limit` equals `min_sqrt_price`. This implies that the swap may attempt to process even when the price boundary is effectively breached. Similarly, if the current tick is at `MAX_TICK - 1`, utilizing `<=` may allow `sqrt_price_max_limit` to equal `max_sqrt_price`, which will result in an invalid operation that tries to push the square root price beyond the maximum limit.

Thus, utilizing `>=` and `<=` in the boundary checks is not appropriate, as allowing the price to hit the exact minimum or maximum boundaries will result in attempts to execute swaps that lead to invalid price states.

## Remediation

Modify the conditions to utilize `<` and `>` instead of `<=` and `>=`. This ensures that the square root price limit is strictly greater than the minimum square root price and strictly less than the maximum square root price.

## Patch

Resolved in `f9025e9`.
