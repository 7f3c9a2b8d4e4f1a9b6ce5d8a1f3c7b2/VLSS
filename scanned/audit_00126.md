# `MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS` Can Be Bypassed when Creating New Pairs

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in `4bccbe5`. Mitigated by checking `liquidation_incentive_bps` to be less than or equal to `MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS`. However, it is still not checked to be greater than or equal to `BASE_BPS`.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** When changing the liquidity incentive via `set_pair_liquidation_incentive_bps()`, it is constrained to be within 100% and `MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS` (150%). However, when creating new pairs via `create_pair_internal()` no such checks exist, allowing potentially higher or lower values, given sufficiently low collateral factor values to pass the coverage checks.

**Recommendation:** Clarify if this is intentional and consider constraining the liquidation incentive accordingly when creating new pairs.
