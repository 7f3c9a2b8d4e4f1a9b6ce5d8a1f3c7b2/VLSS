**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/lending.move`, `isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** The protocol allows the administrator to pause different operations independently. One of these operations is liquidations. However, during high volatility, this can lead to huge amounts of bad debt piling up very quickly.

**Recommendation:** Consider pausing the liquidations as part of general market operations. It does not seem desirable to pause liquidations while users can continue to create positions, potentially further increasing bad debt.
