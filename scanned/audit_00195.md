# Lack of Configurable Delay Setting in Timelock

## Summary
The timelock_upgrade::authorize_upgrade function is using a fixed delay of 24 hours instead of referencing the configurable delay stored in timelock.delay_ms. This makes the customizable delay feature useless and inconsistent. To fix this, the function should use timelock.delay_ms instead of the fixed delay. This issue has been fixed in the latest patch, d2e3a5d.

## Details
## Timelock Upgrade Authorization

The `timelock_upgrade::authorize_upgrade` function utilizes a fixed delay of `MS_24_HOURS` (24 hours) to enforce the time restriction on upgrades, rather than referencing the configurable delay stored in `timelock.delay_ms`. This introduces inconsistency and defeats the purpose of having a customizable delay feature.

```rust
public fun authorize_upgrade(
    timelock: &mut TimelockCap,
    policy: u8,
    digest: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
): UpgradeTicket {
    let epoch_start_time_ms = ctx.epoch_timestamp_ms();
    assert!(
        timelock.last_authorized_time == 0 || epoch_start_time_ms >=
        timelock.last_authorized_time + MS_24_HOURS,
        ENotEnoughTimeElapsed,
    );
    timelock.last_authorized_time = epoch_start_time_ms;
    timelock.upgrade_cap.authorize(policy, digest)
}
```

## Remediation

Utilize `timelock.delay_ms` instead of `MS_24_HOURS` for better customizability.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `d2e3a5d`.
