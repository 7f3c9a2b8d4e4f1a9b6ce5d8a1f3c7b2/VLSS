# Unbounded Waiting Time

## Summary

## Details
## Resume Ride Functionality

The `resume_ride` function allows the setting of an unreasonably high `waiting_time` without any validation. This may result in incorrect or unrealistic data, as waiting times should be within reasonable bounds.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun resume_ride(driver: &Driver, ride: &mut Ride, waiting_time: u64) {
    assert!(driver.driver_address == *option::borrow<address>(&ride.driver),
        EDriverDoesNotMatchRide);
    assert!(ride.state == RideStatusRideStopped, ERideHaventStoppedYet);
    let index = ride.next_stop - 1;
    *vector::borrow_mut(&mut ride.stops, index) = waiting_time;
    ride.state = RideStatusRideStarted;
}
```

## Remediation

Ensure to validate the `waiting_time` utilizing a `Clock` object.
