**Description:** The `PSM`'s price tolerance mechanism, which disables swaps when the oracle price deviates beyond a threshold from $1, presents a fundamental design trade-off that lacks clear resolution. This feature has both protective and destabilizing effects that become particularly significant during market stress.

From a reserve protection perspective, the threshold serves as a critical safeguard. When `USDB` depegs significantly, unrestricted `PSM` swaps would allow arbitrageurs to drain the entire reserve by exchanging devalued `USDB` for fully-valued stablecoins at a 1:1 rate. Given the protocol's lack of bad debt recovery mechanisms, preserving `PSM` reserves becomes essential for maintaining any semblance of stability. The threshold effectively acts as a circuit breaker, preventing complete reserve depletion during severe depegging events.

However, this same mechanism may accelerate the very crisis it aims to prevent. When `USDB` begins depegging and crosses the threshold, the PSM becomes completely non-functional, eliminating the primary arbitrage mechanism that would normally restore the peg. Without `PSM` support, even minor depegs could spiral out of control. Users observing the disabled `PSM` might panic, rushing to close their `CDP`s before conditions worsen, creating selling pressure that drives `USDB` further from its peg. This self-reinforcing cycle could transform a manageable deviation into a downwards spiral.

**Recommendation:** The optimal approach depends on broader protocol design decisions. If bad debt recovery mechanisms are implemented, consider removing or significantly increasing the price tolerance to prioritize peg stability. The `PSM` could then fulfill its role as a stability mechanism even during stress, with bad debt handled through separate systems. Alternatively, if maintaining the threshold, implement graduated responses rather than binary on/off states - for example, increasing fees progressively as prices deviate, or limiting swap sizes rather than disabling entirely. This would preserve some stabilizing effect while still protecting reserves during extreme events.
