# Avoid Unnecessary Operations

## Incentive Rewards Refactor

In `incentive_rewards.move`, the `set_reward_factor` function executes an unnecessary mutable borrow operation on the `reward_factors` table, where a new `coin_type` has been introduced. This procedure is redundant, considering that the recently incorporated entry already possesses the correct `reward_factor` value.

## Remediation
Insert an `else` statement to avoid redundancy.

## Patch
Fixed in `d6d2de5`.
