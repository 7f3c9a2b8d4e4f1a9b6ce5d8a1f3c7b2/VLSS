**Update**
Addressed in: `dbc37d0`. Re-added `(... as u128)` as per recommendation.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** To prevent overflows, the `mul_div_rounded()` function contained unsigned integer widenings `(... as u128)`, which, however, have been removed during the code port. This could unnecessarily lead to overflows and failing calls where `mul_div_rounded()` is being used.

**Recommendation:** We recommend adding back the unsigned integer widening `(... as u128)` to preempt overflows.
