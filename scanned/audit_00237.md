## Liquid Staking Mint Assertion

The assertion in mint within `liquid_staking`, while intended to maintain the balance between Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) and SUI, may abort under certain conditions.

```rust
contracts/sources/liquid_staking.move

public fun mint<P: drop>(
    self: &mut LiquidStakingInfo<P>,
    system_state: &mut SuiSystemState,
    sui: Coin<SUI>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) -> Coin<P> {
    [...]
    // invariant: lst_out / sui_in <= old_lst_supply / old_sui_supply
    // -> lst_out * old_sui_supply <= sui_in * old_lst_supply
    assert!(
        (lst.value() as u128) * old_sui_supply <= (sui_balance.value() as u128) *
        old_lst_supply, EMintInvariantViolated
    );
    [...]
}
```

If `old_lst_supply == 0` and `old_sui_supply > 0`, the assertion will always fail. In this case, the conversion of the provided SUI amount to LST utilizing `sui_amount_to_lst_amount` will return the `sui_amount` itself.

## Remediation

Ensure to handle the above-specified case to prevent the failure of the assertion checks.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `f8b8b00`.
