The `cooldown_underlying_amount` and `cooldown_end_time` functions take a `UserCooldown` and return its `underlying_amount` and `cooldown_end` fields.
```rust
/// Get the underlying amount from a cooldown
public fun cooldown_underlying_amount(cooldown: &UserCooldown): u64 {
    cooldown.underlying_amount
}

/// Get the cooldown end time
public fun cooldown_end_time(cooldown: &UserCooldown): u64 {
    cooldown.cooldown_end
}
```
However, these two view functions are actually unusable because `UserCooldown` is a field within `SdeUSDManagement`, which cannot be directly accessed by external modules. Moreover, the module does not contain any function that returns a reference to `UserCooldown`. Therefore, these two functions cannot be used in practice.

It is recommended to remove these two functions entirely. Alternatively, they can be converted into helper functions for use by the `get_user_cooldown_info` function.
