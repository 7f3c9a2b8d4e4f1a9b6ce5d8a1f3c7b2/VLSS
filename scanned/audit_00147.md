# Multisig Security Enhancements

## Summary
This bug report discusses the current multisig setup which uses 3/5 threshold for internal signers. It suggests that this configuration could be strengthened to 70% for medium and high risk operations. The impact of this bug is medium as it would require multiple signers to be affected, but the likelihood is low due to existing hardware wallet requirements and signing procedures. The report recommends increasing security through external signers and implementing formal key management procedures and enhanced signing procedures. These include adding a trusted third party as a 6th signer, adjusting the threshold to 4/6, and considering a 5/7 configuration in the future. It also suggests annual reviews of the signer set, documented procedures for signer replacement, regular testing of recovery scenarios, and clear criteria for emergency key revocation. Additionally, it recommends enhancing signing procedures by requiring out-of-band transaction hash verification, implementing a mandatory cool-down period for large transfers, creating transaction templates, and documenting specific verification steps for each transaction type.

## Details
## Risk Assessment Report

## Severity
**Medium Risk**

## Description
Current multisig setup uses 3/5 threshold (60%) with all internal signers. While functional, this configuration could be strengthened with a goal of 70% for medium and high risk operations. For further discussion, see this article, [The Right Way To Multisig](URL_TO_ARTICLE).

## Severity Discussion
The impact is medium as compromise would require multiple signers to be affected. The likelihood is low given existing hardware wallet requirements and signing procedures. Current setup is functional but could be enhanced.

## Recommendation

1. **Increase security through external signers:**
   - **Short-term:** Add trusted third party (e.g., security provider partner) as 6th signer.
   - Adjust threshold to 4/6 (66.7%) as an immediate improvement.
   - **Long-term:** Consider expanding to 5/7 configuration as team and protocol grow.
   - Document verification responsibilities for external signer.

2. **Implement formal key management procedures:**
   - Annual review of signer set composition.
   - Documented procedures for signer replacement.
   - Regular testing of recovery scenarios.
   - Clear criteria for emergency key revocation.

3. **Enhance signing procedures:**
   - Require out-of-band transaction hash verification.
   - Implement mandatory cool-down period for large transfers (Note: This is currently not readily available for Aptos multisig wallets but something to keep in mind for the future).
   - Create transaction templates for common operations.
   - Document specific verification steps for each transaction type.
