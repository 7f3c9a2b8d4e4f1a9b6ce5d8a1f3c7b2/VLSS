# Absence of Version Update Functionality

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Configuration Update Limitation

In `config`, there is no mechanism to update the protocol’s version during package upgrades. This limitation will pose significant issues when deploying new versions of the protocol, especially if breaking changes are introduced. The `GlobalConfig` structure contains a version field, which is intended to track the current version of the protocol. The `VERSION` constant is defined in the module, but there is no function to modify the version field of `GlobalConfig` after the initial setup.

## Remediation

Implement a functionality to upgrade the version field within `config`.

## Patch

Resolved in `f9025e9`.
