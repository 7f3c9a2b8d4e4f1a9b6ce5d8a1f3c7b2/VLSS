# The name of the function can cause a misunderstanding

## Summary

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract utility.move, the function name "get_current_timestamp" could be misunderstood as a Unix timestamp, leading to potential confusion for developers who may rely on this function. It would be better to use a more specific name to avoid any confusion. By modifying the function name to "get_time_from_genesis", it will be clearer to developers that the function is not returning a Unix timestamp, but rather the time since the genesis block. This change will help to reduce confusion and potential errors in code that relies on this function.

**Recommendation**: 

Modify the function name to "get_time_from_genesis" to more accurately reflect the function's purpose of calculating the time since the genesis block. This name will be more specific and easier for developers to understand, avoiding any potential confusion.
