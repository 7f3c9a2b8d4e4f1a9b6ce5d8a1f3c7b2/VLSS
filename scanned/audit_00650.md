# Validating Struct Fields Before Updation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Accessing and Modifying Struct Fields in `reserve_config.move` and `interest_rate_config.move`

In `reserve_config.move` and `interest_rate_config.move`, struct fields are accessed and modified using getter and setter functions generated by a TypeScript script. Conditions enforced while instancing these structs should also be enforced while updating fields of the structs using the setter functions outside of instantiation.

## Remediation

A possible method for remediation is asserting the necessary conditions on the fields in their respective setter functions. The below code snippet shows a possible implementation:

```diff
aries-config/sources/reserve_config.move
103 public fun update_loan_to_value(reserve_config: &ReserveConfig,
,→ loan_to_value: u8): ReserveConfig {
104 + assert!(0 <= loan_to_value && loan_to_value <= 100, 0);
105 let new_reserve_config = *reserve_config;
106 new_reserve_config.loan_to_value = loan_to_value;
107 new_reserve_config
108 }
```
