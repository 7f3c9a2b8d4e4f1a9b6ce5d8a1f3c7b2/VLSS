# M-5: SUI TSS drained due to lack of refund when the `withdraw/withdraw_and_call()` PTB fails

## Summary
This bug report discusses an issue with the withdraw_and_call mechanism on the SUI blockchain. This mechanism relies on a Programmable Transaction Block (PTB) that consists of a withdrawal and an on_call function. However, if the on_call function fails, the entire PTB fails and the TSS signer (gateway) does not get refunded for gas fees. This can lead to insolvency and DoS attacks on nodes. The root cause of this issue is a lack of gas refund in a separate PTB.

### Summary

Firstly, SUI [PTBs](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks) or 'Programmable Transaction Blocks' are atomic, that is, whenever a transaction in the bundle reverts, the whole bundle fails
> If one transaction command fails, the entire block fails and no effects from the commands are applied.

The `withdraw_and_call()` mechanism on SUI, relies on a PTB consisting of a withdrawal and a `on_call()` function bundled together, [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-zetachain-cross-chain/blob/main/node/zetaclient/chains/sui/signer/signer_tx.go#L130)
> a withdrawAndCall is a PTB transaction that contains a withdraw_impl call and a on_call call

The `withdraw()` function, used to refund the gas paid to the gateway, directly transfers it as the first tx of the PTB:
```move
entry fun withdraw<T>(
    gateway: &mut Gateway,
    amount: u64,
    nonce: u64,
    receiver: address,
    gas_budget: u64,
    cap: &WithdrawCap,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let (coins, coins_gas_budget) = withdraw_impl<T>(gateway, amount, nonce, gas_budget, cap, ctx);

    transfer::public_transfer(coins, receiver);
    transfer::public_transfer(coins_gas_budget, tx_context::sender(ctx));

    // Emit event
    event::emit(WithdrawEvent {
        coin_type: coin_name<T>(),
        amount: amount,
        sender: tx_context::sender(ctx),
        receiver: receiver,
        nonce: nonce,
    });
}
```

Given these statements, it becomes clear that whenever the PTB fails on the `on_call()` step, the first `withdraw()` tx will also fail, and the gateway (TSS signer) doesn't get refunded, while having paid for the gas fees. This may happen without the failure on the node being caught when simulating the tx because on chain conditions on simulation and when it settles may be different (and can forcibly be different by an attacker frontrunning).



### Root Cause

In `node/zetaclient/chains/sui/signer/signer_tx.go`, withdraw_and_call PTB will make the gateway run out of funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User sends a cross chain withdrawal to SUI, triggering the `on_call()` tx that reverts.
2. The node signs and sends the PTB, and at this point the tx in 1 doesn't revert (diff on chain conditions).
3. The withdraw() tx goes through, but `on_call()` reverts, so the whole PTB is aborted and the gateway loses gas fees without getting refunded.

### Impact

TSS funds leak leading to insolvency and DoSed nodes.

### PoC

See above.

### Mitigation

Gas refund should be performed in a separate PTB so the TSS signer in the node always gets their gas refund.
