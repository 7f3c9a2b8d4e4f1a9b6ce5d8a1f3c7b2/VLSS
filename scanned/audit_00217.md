# Missing Bound Check on Lock Removal

## Summary
The report states that when a lock is removed, it is not completely deleted from the system's SmartTable. This means that the data can still be accessed even after it is supposed to be removed. The report also mentions that the lock_index, which is used to identify specific locks, is not being properly checked and may be out of bounds. This can result in the same lock being removed multiple times, causing the lock count to decrease each time. To fix this issue, the report suggests checking that the lock_index is within the bounds of the total number of investors, and this has been resolved in a patch called "06538b8."

## Details
## Lock Removal in SmartTable

When a lock is removed, it is not actually deleted from the SmartTable storing lock records. This renders the data accessible in the system even after it is supposedly removed. Since locks are not fully removed from the SmartTable, view functions may show locks that should have been deleted. 

Also, the `lock_index` is not validated to ensure it is within the bounds of the investor’s lock count. Thus, the `lock_index` values may be out of bounds, potentially attempting to delete nonexistent records. As a result, the same lock may be removed multiple times repeatedly, each time decreasing the lock count.

## Remediation

- Check that `lock_index <= total_investor_count` in both the view functions and the removal function.

## Patch

Resolved in 06538b8.
