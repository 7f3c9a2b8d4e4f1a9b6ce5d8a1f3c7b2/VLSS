# Constant defined by a value that has not yet been published in the documentation

## Summary
This report discusses a bug in a code called "contract utility.move". The bug is classified as medium severity and has been resolved. The issue is related to a constant called EPOCH_SECONDS, which is meant to represent the time duration of an epoch in seconds. However, it has been found that the value of this constant is based on an example and not the official documentation, and there is no guarantee that it will remain the same. The recommendation is to be aware of this and update the code accordingly.

## Details
**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract utility.move the const EPOCH_SECONDS is supposed to be the time duration of an epoch in seconds. This const will affect the value returned by the functions `get_current_timestamp` and `get_timestamp_from_now_by_days`. The time duration of an epoch is present in the documentation just as an example, and there is no certainty that the value will remain the same.

**Recommendation**: 

Be aware that the value of the const EPOCH_SECONDS comes from an example and not from the official documentation and there is no certainty that the value will remain the same and update the code accordingly.
