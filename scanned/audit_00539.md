# Separate Upgrade Capability From Treasury Capability

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Coin.move Overview

In `coin.move`, TreasuryCap obtained after the creation of the currency has the capability to update the details of the coin. Adopting a distinct `UpgradeCap` exclusively for updating the coin details instead of relying on `TreasuryCap` may be considered an advantageous approach. 

This approach would facilitate a clear distinction between the capabilities needed for various actions such as minting, burning, and updating coin details.

## Remediation

- Separate `UpgradeCap` and `TreasuryCap` to enhance the distinction between these capabilities.
