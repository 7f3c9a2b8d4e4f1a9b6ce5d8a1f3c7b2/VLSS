## Optimization Recommendations for Rewarder and Vault

1. **Rewarder Improvement**  
   Within Rewarder, `add_reward_black_list` may be improved by checking if an address is already present in the blacklist before adding it to avoid duplicate entries. Furthermore, in Vault, the reward information should be updated immediately after adding or removing a vault to or from the blacklist to ensure data consistency.

   ```rust
   > _rewarder.moverust
   public fun add_reward_black_list(
       operator_cap: &OperatorCap,
       config: &GlobalConfig,
       manager: &mut RewarderManager,
       addreses: vector<address>,
       ctx: &mut TxContext
   ) {
       config::checked_package_version(config);
       let operator_address = object::id_address<OperatorCap>(operator_cap);
       config::check_reward_manager_role(config, operator_address);
       vector::append(&mut manager.black_list, addreses);
   }
   ```

2. **Event Emission**  
   Ensure that functions do not emit an event if the action has not been performed, as this will result in the logging of false information, especially affecting off-chain applications monitoring event logs.

3. **Assertion Optimization**  
   The assertion statement in `rewarder::create_rewarder` checks for an existing Rewarder (using `linked_table::contains`). This may be placed earlier to improve efficiency and prevent unnecessary operations in case of a revert.

4. **Vault Rebalance Optimization**  
   `vault::rebalance` performs several operations before checking the value of `rebalance`, which will result in multiple unnecessary operations if the rebalance check were to fail. Move this check to the beginning of the function before any significant operations are executed.

## Remediation
Apply the above optimizations to the codebase.

## Patch
Resolved in commit `971cfd9`.
