# Blocklist Validation Order Mismatch

## Summary
This report describes a bug in the code for a program called committee::execute_blocklist. The bug occurs when the program tries to match a list of Ethereum addresses with a list of committee members. If the order of the addresses in the blocklist does not match the order of the committee members, the program may fail to find the correct member. This can lead to incorrect behavior and may cause the program to stop working. The problem can be fixed by resetting a variable called member_idx to zero at the beginning of each iteration of the outer while loop. This fix has been implemented in a recent update to the program.

## Details
## Vulnerability Report

## Description
In `committee::execute_blocklist`, the `member_idx` variable is not reset to zero at the beginning of each iteration of the outer while loop. Thus, if a blocklist contains Ethereum addresses in a different order than the order of committee members stored in `self.members`, the function may fail to find the corresponding committee member even though the member is present in the list.

```rust
> _ packages / bridge / sources / committee.move
public(friend) fun execute_blocklist(self: &mut BridgeCommittee, blocklist: Blocklist) {
    [...]
    while (list_idx < list_len) {
        [...]
        while (member_idx < vec_map::size(&self.members)) {
            [...]
            member_idx = member_idx + 1;
        };
        assert!(found, EValidatorBlocklistContainsUnknownKey);
        list_idx = list_idx + 1;
    };
    [...]
}
```

If the order of Ethereum addresses in the blocklist does not match the order of committee members stored in `self.members`, incorrect behavior ensues. It may abort the function due to failing assertions, indicating that a validator in the blocklist was not discovered in `self.members`, even though it exists.

## Proof of Concept
Taking `test_execute_blocklist` as an example:
1. Initially, `self.members` contains two members in the following order:
    - Member 1: Ethereum Address = `eth_address0`.
    - Member 2: Ethereum Address = `eth_address1`.
2. Now, suppose the blocklist vector contains Ethereum addresses in the opposite order (`vector[eth_address1, eth_address0]`).
3. During the execution of the `execute_blocklist` function, the outer while loop iterates over each Ethereum address in the blocklist.

### Vulnerabilities
4. For the first Ethereum address (`eth_address1`) in the blocklist:
   - The function begins searching for a matching member in `self.members` starting from the current `member_idx`.
   - Since `member_idx` was not reset to zero at the beginning of the loop, it retains its previous value (index where the last search ended).
   - If `member_idx` is not pointing to the correct index where `eth_address1` is stored, the function will not find a match, and the assertion `assert!(found, EValidatorBlocklistContainsUnknownKey)` will fail.
5. Similarly, for the second Ethereum address (`eth_address0`) in the blocklist, the function continues the search from the incorrect `member_idx`, potentially failing to find the correct member.

## Remediation
Reset the `member_idx` variable to zero at the beginning of each iteration of the outer while loop. This ensures that the search for a committee member starts from the beginning of the member list for each Ethereum address in the blocklist, regardless of its order.

## Patch
Fixed in PR #16955.
