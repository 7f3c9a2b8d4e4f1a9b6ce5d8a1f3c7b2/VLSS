**Update**
Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `61a9e639219efd051f063728c7b09160f107b6e3`.

**File(s) affected:**`perpetual.move`

**Description:** The documentation of the `perpetual::delist_perpetual()` function states that "Funding rates stop accruing" after a market is delisted. However, `perpetual::set_funding_rate()` does not check the `delisted` status. A funding rate operator can continue to call this function, updating the global funding index. Since `exchange::close_position()` settles funding against this global index, users closing positions later could pay significantly more funding than those closing earlier, depending on operator actions. Currently users have to trust the funding rate operator to not update funding rate after delisting.

**Recommendation:** In the `perpetual::set_funding_rate()` function, enforce that the perp is not delisted when updating the funding rate.
