# Explicit Global Initialization of Emitter Registry

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Messages in Wormhole

Messages in Wormhole are sent via emitters which are tracked by a global emitter registry. In order to ensure message integrity, emitter IDs should not be reused and emitter sequence numbers should not be reset.

## Emitter Registry

Currently, the emitter registry is stored in `wormhole::state` and created by a call to `emitter::init_emitter_registry()` during wormhole initialization. The current implementation performs this global initialization exactly once, which is correct.

## Initialization Enforcement

In order to ensure that this initialization does not occur more than once, consider explicitly enforcing this property. For example, one approach is to construct a `HasCreatedEmitterRegistry` struct which is moved to the wormhole account during the initial creation and cannot be dropped or removed.
