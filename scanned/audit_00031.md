Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> Since we use the oracle spot price to calculate the NAV, which is extremely difficult for attackers to manipulate. This finding is almost impossible to occur.

**File(s) affected:**`vault.move`

**Description:** When withdrawing funds, a user specifies the number of shares to burn but has no control over the minimum amount of underlying assets they receive, which is based on the `last_share_price` calculated at the start of the transaction. This exposes users to front-running attacks, where an attacker can execute a trade that negatively impacts the vault's NAV just before the withdrawal, causing the victim to receive fewer assets than expected.

**Recommendation:** Modify the `withdraw()` and `request_withdraw()` functions to accept an additional parameter, `min_amount_out`. This would allow users to specify the minimum amount of assets they are willing to accept for their shares, causing the transaction to revert if the final value falls below this threshold due to slippage or manipulation.
