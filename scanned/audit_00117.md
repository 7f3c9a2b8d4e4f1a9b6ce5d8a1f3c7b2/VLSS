> not a concern

**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/lending.move`

**Description:** Since the efficiency mode id is using `u8` type, zero is reserved and only ever increasing, the protocol is limited to at most 255 different efficiency modes. Furthermore, efficiency modes cannot be deleted.

**Recommendation:** We recommend increasing the efficiency mode type to `u64` to have sufficient room for future modes and/or to free previous ID's after deletion.
