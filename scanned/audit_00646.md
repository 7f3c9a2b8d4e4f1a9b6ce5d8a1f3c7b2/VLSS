# Inconsistent Use Of Check_Admin

## Admin-Only Functions in the Protocol

The protocol implements certain features which are only accessible to the admin, such as: 
- `set_token_per_second`
- `set_treasury`
- etc.

What makes these functions accessible only to the admin is the following check:

## Code Example: `set_token_per_second`

```rust
public entry fun set_token_per_second<StakeCoin, RewardCoin>(admin: &signer, token_per_second: u64) acquires PoolInfo, OwnerCapability {
    let admin_address = signer::address_of(admin);
    let pool_address = account::create_resource_address(&@MeeStaking, POOL_SEED);
    check_admin(pool_address, admin_address);
}
```

The `check_admin` function asserts if the signer is not the admin set at initialization.

## Code Example: `check_admin`

```rust
fun check_admin(pool_address: address, admin_address: address) acquires OwnerCapability {
    let owner_capability = borrow_global<OwnerCapability>(pool_address);
    // check if current signer is real admin
    assert!(owner_capability.admin_address == admin_address,
            error::permission_denied(EINVALID_ADMIN));
}
```

However, this function is not used in all of the functions that are meant to be accessed only by the admin. The program implements the `assert` in the `set_treasury`, `add_pool`, and `transfer_ownership` functions directly.

## Remediation

Replace the lines of code that check if the signer is the admin with a call to the `check_admin` function.
