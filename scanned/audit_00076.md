# [L-04] Missing role bounds check in `has_role`

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
_Resolved_

The has_role function in `sources/acl.move` lacks role bounds validation, unlike other role functions. This inconsistency could cause runtime aborts if invalid role values (≥128) are passed. The issue may arise in future integrations where external contracts pass user-controlled role parameters or during cross-contract calls with unvalidated inputs.

Impact -> Runtime trxs abort instead of graceful error handling, leading to inconsistent API behavior.

Recommendation -> Add `assert!(role < 128, EInvalidRole);` at the beginning of `has_role` function for consistency with add_role and remove_role.
