# [06] Inconsistent upgrade name constants may lead to upgrade handler failures

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
The codebase contains two different constants for the upgrade name:

1. In [`upgrade.go`](https://github.com/initia-labs/minimove/blob/b36d068a7faec31a59d56472e77a9785397f9663/app/upgrade.go# L12): `const upgradeName = "0.6.5"`
2. In [`const.go`](https://github.com/initia-labs/minimove/blob/b36d068a7faec31a59d56472e77a9785397f9663/app/const.go# L46): `const UpgradeName = "0.0.0"`

If any part of the protocol relies on `UpgradeName` for version checks or upgrade logic, it will use an incorrect version (“0.0.0”)
The duplicate constants violate the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle and make maintenance error-prone. There could easily be an error because of this.

### Recommended mitigation steps

Consider consolidating the upgrade name constants into a single location and use a single source of truth.
