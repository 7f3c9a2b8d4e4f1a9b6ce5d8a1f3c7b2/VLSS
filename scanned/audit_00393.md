# Unnecessary Quote Addition

## Counter Quote Vulnerability

`counter_quote` allows the addition of the same quote multiple times without proper validation. The `counter_quotes` vector of the ride may end up containing redundant or duplicate counter quotes for the same driver. This redundant data does not provide any additional information and may result in inefficiency in terms of storage.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun counter_quote(driver: &Driver, ride: &mut Ride, percent: vector<u8>) {
    assert!(ride.state == RideStatusNewRequest || ride.state == RideStatusCounterQuoted, ECannotCounterQuoteForThatRide);
    let counter_quote = CounterQuote {
        percent: percent,
        driver: driver.driver_address,
    };
    vector::push_back(&mut ride.counter_quotes, counter_quote);
    ride.state = RideStatusCounterQuoted;
}
```

## Remediation

Implement proper validation to restrict the addition of the same quote.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `036ada8`.
