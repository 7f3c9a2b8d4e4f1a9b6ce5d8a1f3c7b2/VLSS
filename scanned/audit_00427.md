# Denote MAX_MSAFE_OWNERS_LIMIT Semantic Meaning

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## MSafe Owners Limit and Implementation Details

The maximum limit for the number of owners of an msafe is derived from the `aptos-core` multisig crate’s `MAX_NUMBER_OF_PUBLIC_KEYS`. This semantic dependency should be noted.

## Source Code Reference

Path: `aptos-core/aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib/sources/cryptography/multied25519.move`

```rust
const BITMAP_NUM_OF_BYTES: u64 = 4;

/// Max number of ed25519 public keys allowed in multi-ed25519 keys
const MAX_NUMBER_OF_PUBLIC_KEYS: u64 = 32;
```

Since a nonce public key is added while deriving the authentication key, the values will differ by 1. This should be mentioned in the comments while defining the `MAX_MSAFE_OWNERS_LIMIT`.

## Remediation

Add a comment stating that the const `MAX_MSAFE_OWNERS_LIMIT` is derived from the Aptos `MAX_NUMBER_OF_PUBLIC_KEYS`.
