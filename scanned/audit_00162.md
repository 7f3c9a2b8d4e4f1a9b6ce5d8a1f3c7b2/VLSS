# Exceeding Object Size Limit

## Summary
The issue being reported is related to the maximum size limit for objects stored on a blockchain. Specifically, in the staking_pool, there is a field called StorageNodeInfo which can be set to a very long value by the owner of the node. This can cause problems because it can make the StakingPool object too large, which can then prevent stakers from making withdrawals. To fix this, a length limit should be enforced on the StorageNodeInfo field to keep the overall size of the StakingPool object safe. This issue has been fixed in a recent patch.

## Details
## Issue Overview

The issue revolves around the `max_move_object_size` limit, which restricts the maximum size of objects stored on-chain. In `staking_pool`, if the `StorageNodeInfo.{name,network_address}` field is set to an excessively long value by the node owner, it may contribute significantly to the total size of the `StakingPool` object. This may restrict the addition of new values to `pending_shares_withdraw`, thereby blocking stakers from making withdrawals.

## Remediation

Enforce a length limit on `StorageNodeInfo.{name,network_address}` to ensure that the overall size of the `StakingPool` object remains within safe bounds.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `a1e81c6`.
