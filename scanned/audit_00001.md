# Redundant Additional Check for Insurance Pool

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Description:** The `isolated_trading::apply_isolated_margin()` function makes sure that the insurance fund cannot create new positions, increase existing positions, or flip the position direction. Nevertheless, `exchange::trade()` employs addtional checks that are ineffective. These checks would allow the insurance fund to increase their position, which is unintended:

```
if (insurance_active_pool == maker_address || insurance_active_pool == taker_address) {
    assert!(perp.positions().borrow(insurance_active_pool).size() > 0,
            error::insurance_active_account_can_not_open_new_position());
};
```

**Recommendation:** While the insurance fund cannot effectively increase their position due to the checks in `apply_isolated_margin()`, we recommend removing the redundant code in `exchange::trade()`.
