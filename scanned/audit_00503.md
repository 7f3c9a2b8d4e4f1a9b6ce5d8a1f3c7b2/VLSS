## Security Considerations for Swap Pools

The math calculations for swap pools are crucial from a security standpoint, as rounding issues are vulnerable to exploitation, resulting in a loss of funds from the protocol. Functions with a specific rounding direction are imperative in preventing exploits from surfacing.

## Rounding Guidelines

For instance, the code should round down calculations when calculating the number of tokens given to the user for a specific input token. The rounding in the formulae should involve:

- Rounding down all variables in the formula directly proportional to the output amount.
- Rounding up those variables that are inversely proportional.

Applying said changes should be done on arithmetic operations such as division and exponentiation. Potential rounding issues may be avoided by following these guidelines.

## Remediation

Implement arithmetic functions with specific directions for rounding and utilize them accordingly.

## Patch

Fixed in `951ad53` by including mitigations.
