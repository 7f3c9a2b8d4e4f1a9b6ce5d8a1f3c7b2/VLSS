# Discrepancy In Minimum Stake Requirement

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Move Bridge vs. Solidity Bridge

The Move bridge requires a minimum stake participation of 60%, whereas the Solidity bridge initialization mandates a hard-coded total stake of 100%. This inconsistency creates a scenario where it may not be possible to create a committee for the Solidity bridge, as the total stake required by the Solidity bridge exceeds the minimum stake participation set by the Move bridge.

```solidity
// evm/contracts/BridgeCommittee.sol
require(
    committeeStake[committee[i]] == 0, "BridgeCommittee: Duplicate committee member"
);
committeeStake[committee[i]] = stake[i];
committeeIndex[committee[i]] = uint8(i);
totalStake += stake[i];
}
require(totalStake == 10000, "BridgeCommittee: Total stake must be 10000"); // 10000 == 100%
}
```

## Remediation

Harmonize the stake requirements between the Move bridge and the Solidity bridge.

## Patch

Fixed in PR #16449.
