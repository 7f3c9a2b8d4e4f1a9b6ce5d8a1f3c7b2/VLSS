# [L-03] Ghost members in ACL causing potential storage bloat

## Summary
No summary provided.

_Resolved_

The bug occurs in `remove_role` and `set_roles` functions in acl.move, where members with all roles revoked (roles=0) remain in the `roles_by_member` LinkedTable without automatic removal, leading to accumulation of useless entries via repeated add/clear operations; this bloats storage and increases gas costs/iteration time in `get_members`, degrading performance over time.

As a recommendation, add logic in `remove_role` and `set_roles` to check if roles==0 after updates and invoke `remove_member` to purge empty entries, ensuring efficient table management without impacting existing functionality.
