# Single Bot Design in Liquidation System

## Summary
The report discusses a bug in a protocol's liquidation process. The current process relies on a single bot, which recently failed due to changes in the interface. However, the team was able to manually handle the liquidations as a backup. The impact of this bug is considered medium as manual interventions have proven to be effective, but the likelihood of it occurring is low. The team recommends documenting the manual process and improving the bot's resilience by adding monitoring, redundancy, and thorough testing for interface changes.

## Details
## Risk Assessment Report

## Severity: Medium Risk

### Description
The protocol's liquidation process currently relies on a single bot implementation. When this bot failed due to an interface change, the team successfully fell back to manual liquidations.

### Severity Discussion
The impact is medium as manual intervention has proven effective as a backup. The likelihood is low since market conditions requiring liquidations are relatively rare. While the system could be more robust, the existence of working manual procedures makes this a medium severity issue.

### Recommendation
1. **Document Manual Process:**
   - Create a runbook of the successful manual liquidation procedure.
   - Document team member roles and coordination process.
   - Include procedure for flash loan utilization.

2. **Improve Bot Resilience:**
   - Add monitoring for bot health and execution status.
   - Consider basic redundancy in bot deployment.
   - Maintain thorough test coverage for interface changes.
