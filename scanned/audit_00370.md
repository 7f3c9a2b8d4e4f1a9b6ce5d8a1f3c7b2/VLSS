# Unnecessary Use Of Drop Ability

## Summary

## Details
## FillReceipt Structure in Orderbook

The `FillReceipt` structure within the orderbook is designed to record details regarding the outcome of order matching and execution. Currently, `FillReceipt` includes the drop capability. However, a filled order (represented by `FillReceipt`) is a piece of crucial information that demands processing for accurate system state updates. Dropping a `FillReceipt` object introduces inconsistencies in user accounts, order books, and other system elements. Given that the `FillReceipt` structure requires processing to ensure proper state updates, the drop ability is unnecessary.

```rust
struct FillReceipt has drop, store {
    account_id: u64,
    order_id: u128,
    size: u64,
    dropped: bool,
}
```

## Remediation

Remove the drop ability from `FillReceipt`.
