# Clarify Arguments in create_pair

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Code Review Summary

The first argument in `create_pair` is called `admin` but it is not authenticated:

```move
public(friend) fun create_pair<X, Y>(
    admin: &signer,
) acquires SwapInfo {
    ...
}
```

To prevent misuse, consider renaming this to something that indicates the correct level of privilege.

## Patch
Fixed in `537997c`.
