# Possibility of Overflow Due to Uncapped Flow Limit

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## set_flow_limit

The `set_flow_limit` allows setting the flow limit to any value, including the maximum value that may be stored in a `u64`. This is problematic because, with such a high limit, an overflow may occur in the assertion condition inside `add_flow_out`, which will result in the failure of the assertion check, preventing transfers entirely. While the current system does not actively support setting arbitrary flow limits, a cap should be imposed nonetheless.

```rust
public(package) fun set_flow_limit(self: &mut FlowLimit, flow_limit: u64) {
    self.flow_limit = flow_limit;
}
```

## Remediation

Enforce a reasonable upper bound on the `flow_limit`.

## Patch

Resolved in PR #190.
