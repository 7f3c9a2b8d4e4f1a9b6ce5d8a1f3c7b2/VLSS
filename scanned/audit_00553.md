# Absence Of Checks For Max TTL

## Summary
This bug report discusses a problem with the MAX_TTL constant in registry.move. The issue is that this constant is not being checked when new domains are registered or when a new TTL (Time to Live) value is assigned. This means that users can assign invalid TTL values to their domain names. The code responsible for this check has been temporarily removed and will be rewritten in the future. To fix this issue, proper validation checks need to be implemented to enforce the maximum TTL size during domain registration and when setting the TTL value.

## Details
## TTL Validation Issue in `registry.move`

The `MAX_TTL` constant is present in `registry.move`. However, it is not verified when new domains are registered or a new TTL is assigned. In the absence of this check, users may assign invalid TTL values to their domain names.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public entry fun set_ttl(suins: &mut SuiNS, domain_name: vector<u8>, ttl: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    authorised(suins, domain_name, ctx);
    let domain_name = string::utf8(domain_name);
    let record = get_name_record_mut(suins, domain_name);
    *entity::name_record_ttl_mut(record) = ttl;
    event::emit(TTLChangedEvent { domain_name, new_ttl: ttl });
}
```

```rust
public(friend) fun set_record_internal(
    suins: &mut SuiNS,
    domain_name: String,
    owner: address,
    ttl: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let registry = entity::registry_mut(suins);
    if (table::contains(registry, domain_name)) {
        let record = table::borrow_mut(registry, domain_name);
        *name_record_owner_mut(record) = owner;
        *name_record_ttl_mut(record) = ttl;
        *name_record_linked_addr_mut(record) = owner;
    } else new_record(suins, domain_name, owner, ttl, ctx);
}
```

## Remediation

Implement proper validation checks to enforce the maximum TTL size during domain registration and when setting the TTL value.

## Patch

This portion of the code has been temporarily removed and will be rewritten in the future.
