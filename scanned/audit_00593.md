# Claim For Admin Transfer

## Admin Module Ownership Transfer

In the admin module, `transfer_admin` transfers the ownership of the protocol configuration to `new_admin`.

## Code Snippet

```rust
sources/admin.move RUST

public entry fun transfer_admin(account: &signer, new_admin: address) acquires ConfigV2 {
    let config = borrow_global_mut<ConfigV2>(@Streamflow);
    assert!(
        address_of(account) == config.admin,
        error::permission_denied(EADMIN_NOT_AUTHORIZED)
    );
    config.admin = new_admin;
}
```

However, the function currently changes the admin to `new_admin` directly, which may result in the loss of ownership of the configuration containing crucial parameters if the `new_admin` address is incorrect.

## Remediation

Use a `pending_admin` variable in `transfer_admin` and create a new `claim_admin` function that must be called by the `new_admin` to claim ownership of the protocol configuration.
