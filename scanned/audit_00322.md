# Unconditional Validation During Epoch Zero

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Validators Validation Overview

The `validators::validate_proof` function returns true for any proof validation without performing signature validation when the epoch is zero, allowing the setting of the first operator set. While this is necessary, returning true unconditionally for any proof validation during epoch zero poses a security risk. In particular, `SELECTOR_APPROVE_CONTRACT_CALL` commands without any signatures are also accepted during epoch zero. Thus, approval requests for contract calls may be processed without any validation, resulting in unauthorized contract executions.

```rust
public(package) fun validate_proof(
    validators: &AxelarValidators,
    approval_hash: vector<u8>,
    proof: vector<u8>
): bool {
    let epoch = epoch(validators);
    // Allow the validators to validate any proof before the first set of operators is set (so
    // that they can be rotated).
    if (epoch == 0) {
        return true;
    };
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Restrict unconditional acceptance to only the `SELECTOR_TRANSFER_OPERATORSHIP` command during epoch zero. This ensures that only the transfer of operatorship commands is allowed without validation during the initial setup phase. Other approval commands, such as contract call approvals, should only be accepted once the operator set is established and proper signature validation is performed.
