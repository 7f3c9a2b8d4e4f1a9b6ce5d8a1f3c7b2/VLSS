Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `41dad46bd1bb99ca2af41ac9506ee2a28513a238`.

**File(s) affected:**`signed_int128.move`

**Description:** Several helpers in `s128` can produce a 'negative zero' value, which is inconsistent with treating zero as always positive. This inconsistency can lead to subtle bugs where downstream code assumes all zero values have `sign == true`.

**Recommendation:** Normalize zero across all helpers so that `value == 0` always implies `sign == true`. Adjust the branch conditions or add a normalization step to ensure consistency.
