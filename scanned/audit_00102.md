# [05] Method call syntax in `native_test_only_set_block_info` is not correct

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
`set_block_info` in `native_test_only_set_block_info` function is incorrectly called as a static method using `NativeBlockContext::set_block_info()` syntax when it’s defined as an instance method. This causes a compilation error when the “testing” feature is enabled since the method expects `&mut self` as its first parameter.

### Recommended mitigation steps
```

fn native_test_only_set_block_info(
     let height = safely_pop_arg!(arguments, u64);

     let block_context = context.extensions_mut().get_mut::<NativeBlockContext>();
-    NativeBlockContext::set_block_info(block_context, height, timestamp);
+    block_context.set_block_info(height, timestamp);

     Ok(smallvec![])
 }
```
