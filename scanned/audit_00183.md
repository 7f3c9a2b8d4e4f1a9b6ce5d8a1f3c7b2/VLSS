# Risk of Excess Recall Amount

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Bank Recall Logic Issue

The logic in `bank::recall` may result in a situation where the `amount_to_recall` becomes greater than the available reserves due to the utilization of `max(bank.min_token_block_size)`. The `amount_to_recall` is adjusted to ensure it is at least the size of `bank.min_token_block_size`. 

On recalling an amount smaller than the `min_token_block_size`, the function will automatically increase the recall amount to the minimum block size. The issue occurs if the available funds (the reserves in the bank) are not large enough to accommodate the adjusted `amount_to_recall`.

## Remediation

Ensure that the `amount_to_recall` never exceeds the actual available funds.
