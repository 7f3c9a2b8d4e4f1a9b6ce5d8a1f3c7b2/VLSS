# Missing Handling of DELETE and INCREMENT

## Summary
The `BasePongHandler` contract has a bug where the `_basePongHandler` function does not handle two important operations: `DELETE_UINT256` and `INCREMENT_UINT256`. These operations should delete and increment `uint256` values in storage, but without handling them, the expected actions do not occur. This can lead to incorrect data and protocol failures. The recommendation is to add handling for these operations in the function. The team has accepted the risk of this bug and will not be making any changes to fix it.

## Details
##### Description

In the `BasePongHandler` contract, the `_basePongHandler` function is responsible for handling various packet operations. However, it does not handle two critical operations: `DELETE_UINT256` and `INCREMENT_UINT256`.

* The `DELETE_UINT256` operation should result in the deletion of a `uint256` value from storage. Without handling this case, the deletion will not be performed as expected, leaving stale data in the storage.
* The `INCREMENT_UINT256` operation should increment a `uint256` value in storage. However, without handling it, the expected increment does not occur, leading to protocol logic failures where increments are expected.

Failing to handle these cases could lead to data inconsistencies and incorrect protocol behavior.

##### Recommendation

Add handling for `DELETE_UINT256` and `INCREMENT_UINT256` operations in `_basePongHandler`.

##### Remediation

**RISK ACCEPTED**: The **Concrete team** accepted the risk of this finding. Those instructions do not create a key in `COMMON_STAGE` to be committed later; they only create the key with the instruction inside the `packetKeys` array. This is because they do not need to “move” any value from stage, we only need to either set it to 0 or add 1.
