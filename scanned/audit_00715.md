# Use consistent naming

## Inconsistent Naming of Accounts

Accounts are often inconsistently named across context and struct definitions, which produces less readable code. For example, the `JuicedState` struct has a field named `usdc_vault_key`, which holds the sweeper vault’s public key. In the `DepositWithdraw` context, it is named `vault`. In the `DepositWithdrawMercurial` context, it is named `juiced_usdc_vault`.

## Remediation

Whenever possible, refer to an account by the same name across contexts and structs.
