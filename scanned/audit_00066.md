# Protocol only Supports Hard Liquidations

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
"Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> On purpose. Will upgrade to soft liquidation if needed using the LiquidationRule witness.

**File(s) affected:**`bucket_cdp/sources/vault.move`

**Description:** The liquidation mechanism forces complete position closure regardless of how slightly a position breaches the minimum collateralization ratio. For example, a position at 149% collateralization faces total liquidation despite needing only minimal deleveraging to restore a 150% threshold. This all-or-nothing approach causes unnecessarily severe user losses and discourages efficient capital utilization near the collateralization boundaries.

The implementation allows liquidators to specify repayment amounts but always liquidates proportionally across the entire position rather than targeting a healthy collateralization ratio. This design may hold back users who are looking for optimized capital efficiency, since their position would be extremely risky.

**Recommendation:** Implement partial liquidation logic that calculates and liquidates only the minimum collateral needed to restore a position to a safe collateralization level.
