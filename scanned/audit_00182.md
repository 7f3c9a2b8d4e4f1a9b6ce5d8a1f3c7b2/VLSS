# Lack of Synchronization Between Bank and LendingMarket

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Vulnerability Summary

The vulnerability arises from the lack of full integration between bank and LendingMarket features. It is possible for the `LendingMarketOwnerCap` to create additional `ObligationOwnerCap` instances. This implies that a new obligation may be created without requiring interaction with the Bank module, which should ideally have control over such state changes. 

Furthermore, `claim_rewards_and_deposit` allows for the claim of rewards and automatic deposit of CTokens, which increases the obligation’s CTokens balance. As this feature operates outside the control of the bank, it will not account for these changes in its tracking system.

## Remediation

- Ensure that the bank and lending market are operated by a trustworthy entity.

## Patch

- Acknowledged by the developers.
