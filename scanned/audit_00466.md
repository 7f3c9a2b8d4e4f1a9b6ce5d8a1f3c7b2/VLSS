# Unnecessary Extra Reference

## Details
## Update Stake and Total Stake by Debtor

In the bottle module, `update_stake_and_total_stake_by_debtor` borrows the reference for `Bottle` twice: once for getting the stake amount and once for setting it. 

To optimize this, avoid taking the reference twice by taking the mutable reference once and using it for both getting and setting the value of the stake amount for the bottle.

## Remediation

Take the mutable reference once and use it to get and set the value of the stake amount for the bottle.
