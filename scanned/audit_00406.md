# [H-01] Changing the reward rate results in non-claimable yield

## Summary
This bug report discusses a problem where rewards are not being distributed correctly to validators. This issue occurs when a specific method is called in a certain order, causing the rewards to not be properly calculated. The bug is considered to have a high impact because it results in validators losing out on their accrued rewards. To fix this, the report recommends calling a different method before updating a specific variable. This should only be done when the variable has already been set.

## Details
**Severity**

**Impact:**
High, as accrued rewards won't be distributed to validators

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires method to be called in a specific order

**Description**

The `setDailyRewardRate` in `RewardVault` resets the `lastReward` storage variable to the current day. This means that now when `RewardVault::distributeRewards` is called, only the duration since the latest `setDailyRewardRate` call and the current moment will be used to calculate the accrued rewards. The problem with this approach is if that before calling `setDailyRewardRate` there were accrued but unclaimed rewards, those rewards will not be claimable anymore and the validators will lose on them.

**Recommendations**

Call `distributeRewards` before you update `lastReward` in `setDailyRewardRate`. This should only be done when `lastReward` has already been set.
