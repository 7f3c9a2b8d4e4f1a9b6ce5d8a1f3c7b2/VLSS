# Exposed Email Addresses Used for Critical Services

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity: Low Risk

## Description
Critical service accounts are accessed using email addresses that are publicly known or used for other purposes, increasing security risk. The organization's critical service accounts include social media (Twitter, Discord), and infrastructure admin accounts which require an email address for login. These should not use email addresses that are publicly disclosed. 

The email addresses should not be used for any other purpose - including communications, other services, or public contact. Using shared or known email addresses increases attack surface and makes credential discovery easier for potential attackers.

## Severity Discussion 
The impact is low since exposed email addresses facilitate but do not directly enable attacks, requiring additional security failures to cause harm. The likelihood is medium as these addresses are easily discoverable and regularly targeted, though existing authentication measures prevent direct compromise.

## Recommendation
Implement a dedicated "cold" email address for critical service logins. This email should be:
- Used exclusively for service authentication.
- Not publicly disclosed.
- Not used for any communication.
- Not used for any other purpose.
- Stored securely with limited access.
