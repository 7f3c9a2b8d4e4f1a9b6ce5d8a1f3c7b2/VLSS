## Freezing Metadata in the Sui Blockchain

Freezing the metadata object after validating all metadata values is a recommended practice in the Sui blockchain according to the Sui documentation. This ensures that the metadata of the coin — such as its name, description, symbol, icon URL, and decimal places — remains immutable and consistent after the initial setup.

```rust
> _fdusd.moverust
fun init(otw: FDUSD, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let (treasury_cap, deny_cap, metadata) = coin::create_regulated_currency(
        [...]
    );
    // We could also freeze the metadata object, but if we decide to do that, we need to make
    // sure that all data are filled in correctly, as there is no way to change them later on.
    transfer::public_share_object(metadata);
    transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, ctx.sender());
    transfer::public_transfer(deny_cap, ctx.sender());
}
```

## Remediation

Implement the above-mentioned suggestion.
