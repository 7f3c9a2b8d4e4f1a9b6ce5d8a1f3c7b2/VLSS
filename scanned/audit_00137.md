## Domain Hijacking Risk Assessment

**Severity:** Low Risk

**Description:**   
Domain hijacking remains a critical risk, even with strong account security. Standard transfer locks (`clientTransferProhibited`) prevent unauthorized transfers but do not protect against unauthorized DNS modifications or registry-level attacks. A Registry Lock, where available, adds an extra layer of protection by requiring out-of-band manual approval before any changes can be made at the registry level.

For `.fi` domains, Traficom is responsible for enabling Registry Lock, not AWS or any other provider. The team must contact Traficom directly to determine eligibility and request activation. A WHOIS lookup confirms that Registry Lock is not enabled for `thala.fi`:

```
RegistryLock.......: no
```

## Recommendation:

1. **Contact Traficom to enable Registry Lock (if available).**
   - Email: [firootadmin@traficom.fi](mailto:firootadmin@traficom.fi)
   - Phone: +358 295 345 000
   - Ask if Registry Lock is supported for `.fi` domains and how to enable it.

2. **Restrict AWS Route 53 domain modification permissions:**
   - Ensure only authorized users can change DNS records.
   - Require MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for accounts with domain access.

3. **Set up a simple notification system for unexpected DNS changes:**
   - Using AWS EventBridge (or CloudWatch), configure alerts for Route 53 DNS modifications.
   - Route notifications to an SNS topic to send alerts via email or webhook.
