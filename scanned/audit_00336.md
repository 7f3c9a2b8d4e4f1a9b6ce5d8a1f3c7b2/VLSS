# LACK OF MNEMONIC PHRASE VERIFICATION

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
##### Description

The `Aptos Wallet` did not have any mechanism to verify the provided mnemonic phrase during the wallet creation process after being copied by the user. Lack of this mechanism may pose a significant risk and end up in a fund loss, if the user saves incorrectly the passphrase or forgets to write it down securely.

##### Score

Impact: 2  
Likelihood: 2

##### Recommendation

**RISK ACCEPTED**: The `Pontem Network team` accepted this risk. Currently, the only implemented checks were a warning message showing “Please confirm mnemonic” and a button saying “Resolve”. The user was presented with this warning after the wallet creation. In case the user had not copied the phrase during the process, the wallet would have been created, and the user would not have access to it.
This verification must be implemented before creating the wallet, right after verifying the two input passwords are the same.
The `Pontem Network team` stated that this will also be implemented in a `future release`.
