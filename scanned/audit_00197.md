## Suggestions

1. **Emit msg.sender along with the old and new moveAddress in the Redesignation event to improve clarity.**

   ```solidity
   // src/Lock.sol
   function redesignate(bytes32 moveAddress) public {
       if (frozen) {
           revert LockPeriodEnded();
       }
       emit Redesignation(designated[msg.sender], moveAddress);
       designated[msg.sender] = moveAddress;
   }
   ```

2. **fstMOVE still imports the forge-std library, which is only used for testing and debugging purposes and is not meant to be in production code.**

## Remediation

- Implement the above-mentioned suggestions.
