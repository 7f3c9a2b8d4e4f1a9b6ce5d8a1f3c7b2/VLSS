# Strengthen GCP Infrastructure Security

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity: Low Risk

## Description
The current GCP configuration has several areas that could be strengthened:

- A single service account with “Editor” permissions is used for the collateral auction bot, granting it full control over most resources and violating the principle of least privilege.
- Default-deny firewall rules are not yet enabled, allowing all traffic unless explicitly blocked, which increases the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
- Basic VPC flow logging is not configured, reducing visibility into network traffic and making it harder to detect anomalies, troubleshoot connectivity issues, or audit security events.

## Recommendation

### 1. Implement service account separation:
- Create a dedicated service account for the validator with minimum required permissions.
- Create a dedicated service account for the liquidator bot with minimum required permissions.
- Remove "Editor" permission from the existing shared service account.
- Document ownership and purpose of each service account (L-07 Asset Inventory System).

### 2. Additional security controls.
Here are some practical security measures that minimize risk without adding unnecessary complexity or cost:

- **Enable default-deny firewall rules for both ingress and egress (gradually).**  
  Start by logging traffic first, then apply rules incrementally, ensuring all necessary services have explicit allow rules to prevent disruptions.

- **Enable Basic VPC Flow Logs to detect unusual traffic patterns.**  
  Basic flow logs are free and help monitor network activity. Avoid Detailed logs unless you need deeper insights, as they can become expensive.

- **Enable Cloud Audit Logs for admin activity monitoring.**  
  Admin Activity logs are free and track security-critical actions like IAM changes and API calls. Skip Data Access logs for now.

- **Consider enabling Security Command Center (free tier).**  
  Provides automated security insights but can generate noisy findings. Enable only if someone will review alerts and act on them.
