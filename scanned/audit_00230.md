## Address Removal from Group in `group_holder_config`

Within `remove_address_from_group` in `group_holder_config`, the specified address is removed from its current group (old group), and the `address_info` for the address is updated, setting its `group_id` to `DEFAULT_GROUP`. However, it does not add the address to the holders list of the default group in `config.groups`. By setting `address_info.group_id` to `DEFAULT_GROUP`, the function intends to reassign the address to the default group.

> _rules/group_holder_config/group_holder_config.move rust

```rust
/// Will set the address to the DEFAULT_GROUP.
public fun remove_address_from_group<T>(
    policy: &mut TokenPolicy<T>,
    cap: &TokenPolicyCap<T>,
    addr: address,
) {
    [...]
    // Remove address from old group
    let old_group = address_info.group_id;
    let group = &mut config.groups[&old_group];
    group.remove_holder_address(address_info.holder_id, addr);
    // Update addresses Table
    address_info.group_id = DEFAULT_GROUP;
    // If the below assertion fails, it means that the state of the group-holderconfig is
    // corrupted.
    let holder_addresses = config.holders[address_info.holder_id];
    assert!(holder_addresses.contains(&addr), EImplementationError);
}
```

However, without updating the `DEFAULT_GROUP` in `Group.holders`, the reassignment will be incomplete. This will result in an inconsistency, as the address will appear to belong to the default group based on `address_info`, but it will not be listed as a holder within the actual `DEFAULT_GROUP` in `config.groups`.

## Remediation

Ensure that the address is explicitly added to the holders of the `DEFAULT_GROUP`.

## Patch

Resolved in `f960290`.
