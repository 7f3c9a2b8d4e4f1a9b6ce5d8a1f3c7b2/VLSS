# Reference Pool Manipulation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Deep Price Point Vulnerability

The function `add_deep_price_point` relies on a reference pool to obtain a mid_price, which is then utilized to update the deep price of a target pool. A potential vulnerability arises if the reference pool is unregistered and has an empty order book, allowing malicious actors to manipulate the mid_price. This manipulation could lead to the addition of incorrect deep price points to the target pool, significantly overvaluing or undervaluing the deep price in the target pool. This situation could affect traders and the integrity of the pool.

## Remediation

Ensure that the reference pool is registered before utilizing it to calculate the mid_price.
