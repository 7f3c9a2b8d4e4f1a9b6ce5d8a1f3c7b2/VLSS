# Non-Deterministic Oracle Selection

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Fixed by the client by requiring that users need to collect the prices of _all_ price feeds. This prevents users from "cherry-picking" favorable prices. Addressed in: `d8badbbeea0e666415187a47f065c9c0f3b2c6c0`.

**File(s) affected:**`bucket_oracle/sources/aggregator.move`

**Description:** The oracle system allows users to select different subsets of price feeds to reach the weight threshold, enabling them to obtain multiple valid prices within the same transaction. While we did not identify a direct exploitation path in the current CDP and PSM modules (which only use prices for health checks and divergence thresholds), this non-deterministic design violates oracle best practices and could become exploitable if the protocol evolves. Furthermore, sophisticated users can currently pick a subset of oracles that is most advantageous to them.

The current implementation enables scenarios where a user with oracles weighted 1/1/1 and a threshold of 2 can choose between any two, potentially obtaining different aggregated prices. This flexibility becomes particularly concerning during periods of high volatility when oracle prices naturally diverge due to update delays or network conditions.

**Recommendation:** Implement a deterministic oracle selection model following industry standards. A robust approach uses primary, secondary, and fallback oracles where the primary and secondary prices must agree within a threshold, with the fallback used only when they diverge. This ensures price consistency by requiring two out of three oracles to provide similar values.
