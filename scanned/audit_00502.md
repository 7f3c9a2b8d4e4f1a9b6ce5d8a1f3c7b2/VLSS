# Constraint For Penalty Multiplier And MCR

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Penalty Multiplier and MCR Guidelines

The value of `penalty_multiplier` and `MCR` should be set such that if `CR ≤ 1`, then 

\[
(penalty\_multiplier \times (MCR - CR)) \geq 1.
\]

This implies that 

\[
penalty\_multiplier \geq \frac{1}{(MCR - 1)}
\]

in order to assert that the health of the vault increases after the liquidation.

## Remediation

Enforce the `penalty_multiplier ≥ \frac{1}{(MCR - 1)}` constraint while updating the MCR and `penalty_multiplier`.

## Patch

Fixed in #118.
