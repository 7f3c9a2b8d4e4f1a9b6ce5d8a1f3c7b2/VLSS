**Description:** The `withdraw_reserve<CoinType>` function is used to initiate a reserve withdrawal by the protocol manager. It allows specifying a recipient address for the funds. However, it only calls `coin::register<CoinType>` for the recipient if the recipient is the manager address itself. This can lead to errors when attempting to withdraw funds to a non-manager address.

**Recommendation:** Consider removing the check and registering the recipient's address regardless of whether it is the manager's address or not.
