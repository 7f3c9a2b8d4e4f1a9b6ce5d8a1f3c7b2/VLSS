# Remove Redundant Condition

## Details
## Unstake from Pool Logic

The `unstake_from_pool` function determines whether to split the staked Sui using three conditions.

## Code Snippet (RUST)

```rust
let principal_to_unstake = math::max(principal_to_unstake, min_stake);
let principal_to_unstake = math::min(principal_to_unstake, principal);
let condition = 
    // If unstaked principal is less than available, we cut the amount
    // from the available principal, and return the remainder to the Staking
    // entity.
    principal_to_unstake < principal &&
    // Principal after unstake should be not less than min_stake.
    principal - principal_to_unstake >= min_stake &&
    // Principal by itself can't be less than min_stake value.
    principal > min_stake;

if (condition) {
    // condition could be reduced into two inequalities since the third inequality is implied by the first
    // inequality and min_stake <= principal_to_unstake.
}
```

## Remediation
To simplify the condition, remove the last inequality. The updated code snippet in `storage.move` is:

```

## Patch
This issue was fixed in commit `8820443` by removing the redundant condition.
