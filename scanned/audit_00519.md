# Implement Transfer Function

## Arcade Champion - Hero NFT Transfer Function

`arcade_champion` is currently lacking a function to facilitate the transfer of the Hero NFTs between users. To address this limitation, implement a new function called `transfer`, which allows users to transfer their Hero NFTs to other addresses and handles the transfer logic. Additionally, consider implementing the `lock_hero` functionality if the NFT is not yet locked.

## Code Example

```rust
hero_v0.1/sources/arcade_champion.move RUST

public fun transfer(hero: Hero, user: address, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    if (hero_can_be_updated(&hero)) {
        lock_hero(&mut hero, ctx);
    };
    transfer::public_transfer(hero, user);
}
```

## Remediation

Implement a `transfer` function, which allows users to transfer their Hero NFTs to other addresses.
