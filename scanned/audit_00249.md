## Details
## Current Issue

Currently, `pool_id(&staked_sui)` is called twice in `staking_pool::convert_to_fungible_staked_sui`,  
even though it returns a similar value on both calls.

## Remediation

Store the result of `pool_id(&staked_sui)` in a variable instead of calling it twice in  
`convert_to_fungible_staked_sui`. This avoids redundant calls and improves the function’s efficiency.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `680cbce`.
