## Ride Confirmation Issue

In its current implementation, the system allows a driver to start a ride without confirmation from the rider that they have arrived at the pickup point. This lack of confirmation can lead to potential issues such as miscommunication or misunderstandings between the rider and the driver, affecting the system’s overall customer experience and functionality.

## Remediation

Implement a mandatory confirmation process, where the rider must explicitly confirm that the driver has arrived before the ride can commence.

## Patch

Fixed in `adc6fc8`.
