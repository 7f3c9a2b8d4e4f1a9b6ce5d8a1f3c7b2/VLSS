# Enforcing Unlimited Deposit and Borrow Limits

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Reserve Configuration in `reserve_config.move`

In `reserve_config.move`, the struct `ReserveConfig` stores deposit and borrow limits that need to be enforced on the relevant reserve. It is mentioned in the comments that if the deposit and borrow limits values of the struct are `0`, then no limits will be enforced on the deposit and borrow functions in that reserve. However, the behavior described is not implemented in the functions that return those values.

Below is the code snippet that contains the said comments:

```rust
// 0 represents no limit
deposit_limit: u64,
// 0 represents no limit
borrow_limit: u64,
```

## Remediation

A possible method for remediation is returning `u64_MAX` if those values are `0`. The below code snippet shows the changes that could be made:

```diff
public fun deposit_limit(reserve_config: &ReserveConfig): u64 {
+ if (reserve_config.deposit_limit == 0) {
+     18446744073709551615
+ } else {
    reserve_config.deposit_limit
+ }
}

public fun borrow_limit(reserve_config: &ReserveConfig): u64 {
+ if (reserve_config.borrow_limit == 0) {
+     18446744073709551615
+ } else {
    reserve_config.borrow_limit
+ }
}
```
