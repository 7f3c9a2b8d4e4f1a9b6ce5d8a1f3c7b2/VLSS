# GuardianSetChanged Event is Unused

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## GuardianSetChanged Event

The `GuardianSetChanged` event is defined in the wormhole state module:

```rust
wormhole/sources/state.move 
struct GuardianSetChanged has store, drop {
    oldGuardianIndex: U32,
    newGuardianIndex: U32,
}
```

It would make sense to emit this event during `state::update_guardian_set_index`, however, this is currently unimplemented.

## Remediation

Emit the event during `state::update_guardian_set_index`.
