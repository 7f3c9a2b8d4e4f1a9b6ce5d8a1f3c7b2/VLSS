# Non-Ascending Epoch Claims

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Issue Description

The issue is with regards to `set_withdraw_time_limit`, which grants administrators the ability to define the time limit for withdrawing staked tokens. To elaborate, should the administrator elevate the `withdraw_time_limit` to surpass the present timestamp calculated from the inception of the epoch, it may result in a scenario where a user generates two `UnstakeTicket` objects within the same epoch.

## Code Snippet

```rust
sources/manage.move RUST
public entry fun set_withdraw_time_limit(_: &AdminCap, staking: &mut Staking, withdraw_time_limit: u64) {
    staking::assert_version(staking);
    config::set_withdraw_time_limit(staking::get_config_mut(staking), withdraw_time_limit);
}
```

In particular, if the timestamp (X) of the first ticket exceeds `epoch_timestamp_ms + old_limit`, and the timestamp (Y) of the second ticket falls below `epoch_timestamp_ms + new_limit`, the resultant `EpochClaim` for these two tickets will correspond to epochs E+2 and E+1, respectively. This creates a scenario where the epoch claims are in a non-ascending order, which is problematic as epoch claims should be in ascending order. This non-ascending order may disrupt the normal flow of epoch-based operations.

## Remediation

Ensure that changes to `withdraw_time_limit` are carefully managed, considering the potential impact on the timestamp-based order of epoch claims.

## Patch

Fixed in `2d543ae`.
