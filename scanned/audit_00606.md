# Constraint For Penalty Multiplier And MCR

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Guidelines for Penalty Multiplier and MCR 

The value of `penalty_multiplier` and `MCR` should be set such that if **CR ≤ 1**, then:

\[
(penalty\_multiplier * (MCR - CR)) \geq 1
\]

This implies that:

\[
penalty\_multiplier \geq \frac{1}{MCR - 1}
\]

In order to assert that the health of the vault increases after the liquidation.

## Remediation 

Enforce the `penalty_multiplier ≥ 1/(MCR - 1)` constraint while updating the MCR and penalty_multiplier.

## Patch 

Fixed in #118.
