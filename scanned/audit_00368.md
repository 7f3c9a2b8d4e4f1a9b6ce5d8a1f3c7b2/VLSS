# Missing Validations

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Findings

1. In `place_market_order` and `place_limit_order` within `orderbook`, there is an absence of validation for the price and size parameters, allowing these parameters to take on zero values, which is nonsensical, particularly in the context of a market order.

2. In the current implementation of `clearing_house`, the `lot_size` and `tick_size` parameters have no checks to define their range. It should be asserted that `lot_size` and `tick_size` are greater than zero and less than `constants::one_b9` to ensure `tick_size` is a positive value and falls within a reasonable range.

3. `increase_counter` in `orderbook` should include an assertion to verify that the counter is less than `0x8000_0000_0000_0000` before incrementing it. This precaution is necessary to prevent potential overflow issues with the counter value.  
   > _sources/orderbook.move  
   > /// Increases `counter` and returns its new value.  
   > fun increase_counter(counter: &mut u64): u64 {  
   > *counter = *counter + 1;  
   > *counter  
   > }

4. Within `clearing_house`, the possibility of withdrawing zero amounts in `withdraw_insurance_fund` is observed, and it is advisable to prevent this, as it does not affect the state of the insurance fund.

## Remediation

1. Ensure that range validations are implemented for the `price`, `size`, `lot_size`, and `tick_size` variables.
2. Include an assertion check in `increase_counter` to guard against potential overflow.
3. Explicitly assert the withdrawal amount is greater than zero.
