# Additional Safety Checks

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Code Review and Recommendations

## 1. Registry Service Attribute Validation

The function `registry_service::set_attribute` should ensure that the `attribute_value` corresponds to a set of acceptable values defined for each `attribute_id`, to prevent assigning values that do not align with the specific attribute’s intended purpose. Additionally, confirm that `attribute_expiration` is within the allowed range.

## 2. Compliance Service Issuance Time Validation

The current implementation of `compliance_service::validate_issuance_time` only checks if back-dating is allowed. It does not verify whether the provided `issuance_time` is less than or equal to the current timestamp.

```rust
>_ move/sources/compliance_service.move rust
fun validate_issuance_time(issuance_time: u256): u256 acquires Miscellaneous {
    if (!get_disallow_back_dating()) {
        return issuance_time;
    };
    return (timestamp::now_seconds() as u256);
}
```

## 3. Wallet Address Validation

There is no address validation in `ds_token::check_wallets_for_list` to ensure it does not perform any list operations for the zero address (`@0x0`).

## Remediation Recommendations

1. Include the additional validation checks on both the `attribute_value` and `attribute_expiration` fields, as mentioned above.
2. Add a check to ensure that the issuance time is not in the future.
3. Verify that `check_wallets_for_list` does not operate on a zero address.
