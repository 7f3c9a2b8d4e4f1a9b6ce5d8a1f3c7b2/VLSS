## Findings

1. **Faulty Validation in Configuration**
   - The functions `config::add_operator` and `config::set_tier` are missing a version validation check, resulting in possible version mismatch errors. The functions should call `checked_package_version(global_config)` to ensure the current package version in the `GlobalConfig` matches the constant defined in the module (`VERSION`).

2. **Package Version Check**
   - The function `set_package_version` fails to explicitly check whether the new version is an upgrade (i.e., whether the new version is greater than the old version). If someone accidentally attempts to set a version lower than the current version (downgrade), the function will still update the configuration without raising any warnings. The function should check that the `new_version` is greater than `global_config.package_version`.

3. **Explicit Validation of Parameters**
   - When the `vault`, `clmm_pool`, and `strategy` objects are passed as parameters to functions, explicitly validate their relationships to ensure data consistency and prevent possible manipulation of values.

4. **Recipient Address Validation**
   - The function `vault::collect_clmm_reward_direct_return` should validate the recipient address before using it, as the recipient argument may be manipulated to spoof this value in the emitted event.

   ```rust
   > _vault.move_rust
   public fun collect_clmm_reward_direct_return<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB, FeeType,
   → RewardCoinType>(
       global_config: &GlobalConfig,
       strategy: &mut Strategy,
       vault: &Vault,
       clmm_pool: &mut Pool<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB, FeeType>,
       clmm_positions: &mut Positions,
       clmm_reward_vault: &mut PoolRewardVault<RewardCoinType>,
       clmm_reward_index: u64,
       recipient: address,
       clock: &Clock,
       clmm_versioned: &Versioned,
       ctx: &mut TxContext
   ): Coin<RewardCoinType> {
       config::checked_package_version(global_config);
       assert!(strategy.status == 0, EStrategyLocked);
       assert!(strategy.clmm_pool_id == object::id(clmm_pool), ENotTheCorrespondingStrategy);
       [...]
   }
   ```
