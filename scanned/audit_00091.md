# [M-02] Unstaking calculates user share at request time, ignoring slashing — leading to DoS and unfair distribution

## Summary
This bug report describes an issue with the staking and unstaking process in the Cabal protocol. When users stake their tokens, they are delegated to validators and may be subject to slashing events, where a portion of their tokens may be penalized. However, the current unstaking process does not properly account for these events, leading to potential exploits and unfair distribution of losses.

The recommended mitigation steps suggest storing the user's percentage share of the total LP supply instead of locking in the claimable amount at unstake time. This ensures that slashing risk is shared proportionally among all stakers and prevents potential denial of service attacks or overclaiming exploits.

Two scenarios are presented as proof of concept, highlighting the current flawed behavior and what should happen instead. In the first scenario, a large user unstakes and expects to claim a certain amount, but if the pool is slashed before they claim, there may not be enough tokens left to fulfill their claim. In the second scenario, an early user unstakes and claims the full amount before a slash occurs, leaving the remaining users to absorb the full impact of the slash.

The recommended solution would recalculate the claim amount at execution time, taking into account the current state of the pool. This would ensure fair distribution of losses among all stakers.

### Finding Description and Impact

Users can stake both INIT and LP tokens into different validator pools by calling functions like `deposit_init_for_xinit` or `stake_asset`. To exit, users initiate an unstake via `initiate_unstake`, which starts an unbonding period. After this delay, they can claim their tokens through `claim_unbonded_assets`.

Behind the scenes, these staked assets are delegated to validators, and slashing may occur—meaning a portion of the delegated tokens could be penalized (burned). To stay accurate, the protocol uses `pool_router::get_real_total_stakes` to track the current delegated amount. However, the current unstaking flow doesn’t properly account for slashing events that may occur during the unbonding period.

When a user initiates an unstake, either `process_lp_unstake` or `process_xinit_unstake` is called. For simplicity, we focus on `process_lp_unstake`.

In [`process_lp_unstake`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-cabal/blob/main/sources/cabal.move# L1043C1-L1083C6), the claimable amount is calculated up front at unstake time:
```

let reward_amount = compound_lp_pool_rewards(m_store, unstaking_type);
let lp_amount = reward_amount + pool_router::get_real_total_stakes(...);
let cabal_lp_amount = option::extract(...);
let ratio = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u128(unstake_amount as u128, cabal_lp_amount);
let unbonding_amount = bigdecimal::mul_by_u64_truncate(ratio, lp_amount);
...
vector::push_back(&mut cabal_store.unbonding_entries, UnbondingEntry {
    ...
    amount: unbonding_amount,
    ...
});
```

Later, in [`claim_unbonded_assets`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-cabal/blob/main/sources/cabal.move# L711C22-L750), this precomputed amount is blindly transferred to the user:
```

primary_fungible_store::transfer(
    &package::get_assets_store_signer(),
    metadata,
    account_addr,
    amount // ← Precomputed at unstake time
);
```

This design introduces a critical flaw: it assumes the pool value remains constant between unstake and claim, which is not guaranteed. If slashing happens during this period:

* A large user may claim more than the pool holds → DoS
* An early user may claim full value post-slash → Other users absorb full loss

**NB:**
This differs from systems like Lido, where the amount returned is computed at claim time based on the user’s share of the pool, ensuring fair slashing distribution.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of locking in the claimable amount at unstake time, store the user’s **percentage share** of the total LP supply. Then, during `claim_unbonded_assets`, recalculate the actual amount using the current pool value (i.e., post-slash).

This ensures slashing risk is shared proportionally among all stakers, and prevents DoS or overclaiming exploits.

### Proof of Concept

**Case 1 – Whale Unstakes 50%, Then Pool Is Slashed by 51%**

**Scenario:**

* Total pool value: 1,000 LP tokens
* A whale holds 500 LP and unstakes it, expecting to claim 500 units
* The remaining users hold the other 500 LP
* Before the whale claims, the pool is slashed by 51%, reducing it to 490 units

**Current behavior (problem):**

* The whale still tries to claim 500 units
* The pool only has 490 units left → this would revert, fail, or break accounting
* Essentially, the whale locks in a pre-slash value and now the pool can’t fulfill it

**What should happen:**

* Claim should be recalculated at execution time
* 500 LP × (490 / 1000) = 245 units
* Whale gets 245 units, the rest of the pool reflects that slashing fairly across all holders

**Case 2 – Early User Unstakes, Pool Slashed, Claims Full Amount**

**Scenario:**

* Pool has 1,000 LP total
* User A holds 100 LP, unstakes and expects 100 units
* User B holds 900 LP
* A 50% slash hits before User A claims → pool is now worth 500 units

**Current behavior (problem):**

* User A claims 100 units (based on original rate)
* Only 400 units remain for User B’s 900 LP
* That means User B absorbs the full impact of the slash — clearly unfair

**What should happen:**

* Claim is based on current pool state
* 100 LP × (500 / 1000) = 50 units
* User A gets 50 units, User B’s 900 LP is worth 450 → everyone shares the slash proportionally
