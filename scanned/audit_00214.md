# Incongruities in Role Management Checks

## Role Assignment Inconsistencies

There are several inconsistencies with the role assignment in the system. In `registry_service` for `register_investor` (shown below) and `add_wallet`, access is restricted to only specific roles, limiting it to issuers, transfer agents, or higher authority roles. However, the requirement is that these functions should be callable by any role, implying that the Exchange role (represented by role ID 4) should also be able to call these functions. Ensure that the Exchange role is also allowed to call the above two functions.

```move
move/sources/registry_service.move rust
public entry fun register_investor(
    authorizer: &signer, id: String, collision_hash: String
) acquires InvestorInfo {
    trust_service::assert_only_issuer_or_transfer_agent_or_above(authorizer);
    assert!(!is_investor(id), EINVESTOR_ALREADY_EXISTS);
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Address the above discrepancies in role management.

## Patch

Resolved in commit `06538b8`.
