# Missing Chain ID Validation

## Summary
The bug report discusses a problem with the chain id assignment in the Aptos network. The report explains that the chain id is used to uniquely identify a network and lists the different chain ids that are reserved for specific purposes. The bug occurs when the chain id is not properly validated, which can lead to transactions being replayed on the wrong chain. This can cause issues with multisig transactions and pose a potential risk for user experience. The report suggests a solution to validate the chain id in a specific function and provides a code patch to fix the issue. The bug has been fixed in a recent update.

## Details
## Chain Id and Transaction Validation

In order to uniquely identify a network, a chain id is assigned.

## Rust Code

```rust
pub enum NamedChain {
    /// Users might accidentally initialize the ChainId field to 0, hence
    /// reserving ChainId 0 for accidental initialization.
    /// MAINNET is the Aptos mainnet production chain and is reserved for 1.
    MAINNET = 1,
    // Even though these CHAIN IDs do not correspond to MAINNET, changing
    // them should be avoided since they can break test environments for various organisations.
    TESTNET = 2,
    DEVNET = 3,
    TESTING = 4,
    PREMAINNET = 5,
}
```

Transactions can be replayed from one chain to another if this field isn’t properly validated. In the context of a multisig, the transaction can be added but will fail at execution. Nonetheless, this represents a potential UX risk and is worth remediating.

## Remediation

Validate `chain_id` in the `validate_txn_payload` function.
