# Missing input validation could result in an insolvent vesting plan

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
##### Description

During the creation of a vesting plan, the `create` function, which can be called by anyone, currently lacks validation for the accuracy of the following arguments: `_start_at_sec`, `_end_at_sec`, `_initial_amount` and `_total_amount`.

This oversight presents integrity issues, potentially leading to the following scenarios:

* Creation of a vesting plan allowing the user to claim more than the total amount if the provided initial amount exceeds the total amount.
* Creation of a vesting plan with a start time in the past or one that has already expired.
* Creation of a vesting plan with `start_at_sec` equaling `end_at_sec`, resulting in a division by zero error when calling `get_claimable` and related functions (such as `cancel` and `claim`).
* Creation of a vesting plan where 'start\_at\_sec' is greater than `end_at_sec`, causing an underflow error when calling `get_claimable` and related functions with the current timestamp exceeding the vesting plan's start time.

Code Location
-------------

The `create` function does not validate the user-provided arguments:

```
public fun create(
        _user_address: address,
        _start_at_sec: u64,
        _end_at_sec: u64,
        _initial_amount: u64,
        _total_amount: u64,
        _claimable_fa_store_claim_cap: claimable_fa_store::ClaimCapability
    ): (VestingPlan, ClaimCapability, AdminCapability)
    acquires VestingConfig {
        let config = borrow_global_mut<VestingConfig>(@merkle);
        let uid = config.next_uid;
        let vesting_plan = VestingPlan {
            uid,
            user: _user_address,
            start_at_sec: _start_at_sec,
            end_at_sec: _end_at_sec,
            initial_amount: _initial_amount,
            total_amount: _total_amount,
            claimed_amount: 0,
            paused: false,
            claimable_fa_store_claim_cap: _claimable_fa_store_claim_cap
        };
        config.next_uid = config.next_uid + 1;
        (vesting_plan, ClaimCapability { uid }, AdminCapability { uid })
    }
```

##### Recommendation

Consider validating user-provided inputs by ensuring the following criteria:

* The initial amount is less than the total amount.
* The current timestamp is before the start time, and the end time is between the start time and a valid upper limit.
