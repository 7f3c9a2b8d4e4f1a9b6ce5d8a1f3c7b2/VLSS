# Permanent Loss Of Expired Rewards

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Reward Claim Policy

Currently, if rewards are not claimed within a 14-day period, they become inaccessible and may not be retrieved or re-utilized. The `claim_rewards` function contains a check that ensures rewards may only be claimed if they are within a 14-day window from their registration. If this period expires, the reward claim fails with the `E_CLAIM_EXPIRED` error. This rule is meant to ensure that rewards are claimed in a timely manner.

## Code Snippet

```rust
protocol_reward.move rust
public fun claim_rewards<AssetType>(_user: &signer, _epoch_start_at: u64)
acquires EpochReward, ProtocolRewardEvents, UserRewardInfo {
    [...]
    let reward = smart_table::borrow_mut(&mut epoch_reward.reward, _epoch_start_at);
    assert!(timestamp::now_seconds() - reward.registered_at <= DAY_SECONDS * 14,
    ,→ E_CLAIM_EXPIRED);
    [...]
}
```

However, this implies that any rewards not claimed within the 14-day window become permanently inaccessible. If rewards are not claimed within the allowed time frame, they are lost and cannot be reclaimed or utilized in future epochs. Over time, this will result in a significant accumulation of unclaimed rewards, which effectively go to waste.

## Remediation

Implementing a recycling mechanism to reallocate expired rewards to future epochs or a special pool may address this issue, ensuring that resources are utilized more effectively and that users benefit from rewards that would otherwise be lost.

## Patch

Fixed in `906ec95` by including a function that allows for the withdrawal of expired rewards.
