# Unutilized Initial Supply

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Lending Pool Initialization

The `lending_pool::create` function allows for an initial supply of fungible assets to be deposited into the pool:

- **Parameter:** `initial_supply: FungibleAsset`
  
This initial supply is **not** reflected in any of the pool’s state variables. As a result, the initial supply is essentially meaningless and permanently stuck in the pool without contributing to the pool’s reserves or shares.

```rust
// lending_pool.move
public(friend) fun create(
    token: String,
    initial_supply: FungibleAsset,
    [...]
)
```

## Remediation

Ensure the initial supply is reflected in the pool’s `total_reserves` and `total_supply_shares` by updating these variables with `amount_initial_supply`. Consequently, these funds may serve as dead shares to mitigate any share inflation attacks.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `620b60f`.
