# Ambiguity In Withdrawl Frequency Checks

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Protocol Validation Explanation

The `protocol::create` function only ensures that `withdrawal_frequency` is above 30 but does not validate that `withdrawal_frequency` is greater than or equal to `contract.period`, unlike the `update` function.

## Source Code
File: `sources/protocol.move` (RUST)

```rust
assert!(new_withdrawal_frequency == 0 || new_withdrawal_frequency >= contract.period, EBADINPUT);
if (new_withdrawal_frequency == 0) {
    new_withdrawal_frequency = contract.period;
}
if (new_withdrawal_frequency < 30) {
    new_withdrawal_frequency = max(30, contract.period);
}
```

## Remediation
Ensure that `withdrawal_frequency` is always greater than or equal to `contract.period` in `create` to avoid inconsistencies.

## Patch
Fixed in commit `bd4f2e9`.
