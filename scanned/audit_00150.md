# Unconstrained Vercel Spending Limits

## Summary
The report states that there is a medium risk bug in Vercel's spend monitoring and control mechanisms. This means that there is a potential for unexpected charges or abuse of resources. Currently, the spending is only monitored manually on a monthly basis, without any automated alerts or controls. It is recommended to enable Vercel's free spend management features, which include setting a maximum spend threshold, enabling automatic pausing when the threshold is reached, and setting up spend alert notifications at different percentages of the threshold. It is also suggested to configure notification webhooks for Slack integration. These measures will provide better oversight and early warning of any unusual activity that could indicate security issues or resource abuse.

## Details
## Severity: Medium Risk

## Description
Spend monitoring and control mechanisms are not configured in Vercel, creating risk of unexpected charges or potential abuse. Currently, spending is monitored manually on a monthly basis without automated alerts or controls. Automatic controls would provide better oversight and early warning of unusual activity that could indicate security issues or resource abuse.

## Recommendation
Enable Vercel's free spend management features:
- Set maximum spend threshold significantly above normal usage.
- Enable automatic pausing when threshold is reached.
- Enable spend alert notifications at:
  - 25% of threshold.
  - 50% of threshold.
  - 75% of threshold.
- Configure notification webhooks for Slack integration.
