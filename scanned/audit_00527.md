# Improve Check For Second Highest Bid

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Auction Bid Validation in auction.move

The file `auction.move` includes checks for the creation time of the highest bid to ensure that it falls within the appropriate range. However, no such checks are included for the second highest bid.

### Code Snippet

```rust
if (
    bid_detail.bid_value_mask < value
    || value < min_price
    || bid_detail.created_at_in_epoch < entry.started_at
    || entry.started_at + BIDDING_PERIOD <= bid_detail.created_at_in_epoch
) {
    // invalid bid
    // TODO: what to do now?
} else if (value > entry.highest_bid) {
    // Vickrey auction, winner pays the second highest bid
    new_winning_bid(entry, bid_detail);
} else if (value == entry.highest_bid && bid_detail.created_at_in_ms < entry.winning_bid_created_at_in_ms) {
    new_winning_bid(entry, bid_detail);
} else if (value > entry.second_highest_bid) {
    // not winner, but affects second place
    new_second_highest_bid(entry, value, tx_context::sender(ctx));
} else {
    // bid does not affect auction
    // TODO: what to do now?
}
```

## Remediation

Implement the same creation time check for the second highest bid as was applied to the creation time of the highest bid.
