# Presence Of Infinite Loop

## Summary
The fare calculation functions in the fare module are not working properly due to an issue with the while loop. The loop is not incrementing the variable i inside the first condition, causing it to always execute a continue statement. This results in an infinite loop and incorrect fare calculation. To fix this, the loop needs to be modified to ensure that i is incremented before the continue statement is executed.

## Details
## Fare Estimation Functions

The functions `estimate_fare` and `calculate_final_fare` are used to determine the fare amount for a particular ride based on several factors, including waiting time, boost percentages, discounts, and additional charges.

## Issue Description

There is an issue regarding the `while` loop that checks for the number of stops. The condition `*vector::borrow(&stops, i) < 3` is problematic. If a ride consists of less than three stops, the first condition in the `while` loop is executed, containing a `continue` statement, which results in the loop moving on to the next iteration.

### Code Snippet

```rust
public fun calculate_final_fare(
    [...]
): u64 {
    let waiting_time = 0;
    if (vector::length(&stops) > 0) {
        let i = 0;
        while (i < stop_index) {
            if (*vector::borrow(&stops, i) < 3) {
                continue;
            } else {
                waiting_time = waiting_time + *vector::borrow(&stops, i);
            };
            i = i + 1;
        };
    };
    [...]
}
```

However, the loop does not increment `i` inside the first condition. Thus, the `continue` statement will always be executed in such cases, and `i` will never be incremented. This results in an infinite loop, as the loop conditions `i < vector::length(&stops)` and `i < stop_index` in `estimate_fare` and `calculate_final_fare` respectively, will always be true.

## Remediation

To fix this issue, ensure that `i` is incremented inside the loop body regardless of the condition by adding `i = i + 1` prior to the `continue` statement.
