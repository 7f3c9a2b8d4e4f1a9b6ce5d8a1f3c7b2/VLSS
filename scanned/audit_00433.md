# Incorrect Counting Dynamic Field Access

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Field Requests Counter

The `field_requests_counter` is a variable that stores the number of accesses to a dynamic field. The following are codes of incorrect counting:

1. `set::front` does not read a value from the dynamic field.
2. In the while loop of `process_pending_unstake_requests`, aside from the call to `ssvs::pop_pending_unstake_record(staked_sui_vault)`, there are no other function calls related to the dynamic field.

## Remediation

1. Remove the addition.

   ```diff
   storage.move DIFF
   @@ -278,7 +278,6 @@ module lsd::storage {
   // If there is no next node, jump to the head of the deque.
   if (!is_some(pool_id_opt)) {
       pool_id_opt = set::front(&storage_state.unstaking_deque);
   - *fields_requests_counter = *fields_requests_counter + 1;
   }
   ```

2. Change add four to add one.

   ```diff

   };
   ```

## Patch

Fixed in `1257916` by correcting the counting according to the actual number of dynamic field accesses.
