# Inefficient Allocation of Resources

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Stake Assignment and Validator Performance

The protocol does not consider the performance of validators when assigning stake. Frozen or broken validators will receive stake despite not contributing to generating rewards. Additionally, there is no inbuilt mechanism to rebalance stake between old validators and newly joined validators. Natural deposits and withdrawals will have the effect of rebalancing stake but at a much slower rate.

## Remediation

- Consider adding a mechanism to track validator performance and distribute stake proportionally.
- Consider adding a mechanism to rebalance stake between existing validators.
