# Use Of Hard-Coded Values

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Code Base Considerations

The code base uses hard-coded values like `110` (for MCR). In the future, if the constant value changes, it would require the developer to change all the instances of the hard-coded values.

## Remediation

Obtain values (such as MCR) programmatically and use that instead.
