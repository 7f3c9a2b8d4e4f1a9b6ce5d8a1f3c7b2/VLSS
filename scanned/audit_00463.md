## Handle Redistribution in the Bucket Module

The `handle_redistribution` in the bucket module handles the collateral and debt redistribution to the users. The calculation of the remaining collateral after taking out the fee and rebate amount is improper, giving less precise values.

## Remediation

Calculate the `collateral_amount` as follows:

```
collateral_amount = collateral_amount - (2 * rebate_amount)
```

to avoid precision loss.
