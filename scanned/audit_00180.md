# Missing Validation Logic

## Code Improvements

1. **Token Type Check**
   - Include a check to ensure that the two tokens involved in the creation of the pool are of different types.

2. **Reserve-to-LP Supply Ratio Validation**
   - `pool::redeem_liquidity` includes a check for the consistency of the reserve-to-LP supply ratio via `assert_lp_supply_reserve_ratio`, but it only validates the ratio for `coin_a` and ignores doing the same for `coin_b`. Thus, any inconsistency in coin B’s reserves will go undetected, resulting in unbalanced pool reserves. 
   - Call `assert_lp_supply_reserve_ratio` for `coin_b` as well.

3. **Validation for Coin Inputs and Outputs**
   - `redeem_liquidity`, `deposit_liquidity`, `mint_btokens`, and `burn_btokens` do not validate whether `coin_in` and `coin_out` are zero, which impacts the correctness of these operations. Allowing zero-value minting, burning, deposit, and withdrawing is unnecessary, wastes computational resources, and adds noise to event logs. 
   - Ensure `coin_in` and `coin_out` are not zero. Similarly, `pool::swap` should check that the `amount_in` is greater than zero.

4. **Handling Edge Cases in LP Token Calculation**
   - `pool_math::lp_tokens_to_mint` may return zero in certain edge cases if `amount_a` or `amount_b` is too small relative to `reserve_a` or `reserve_b`. 
   - Add appropriate handling for such cases.
