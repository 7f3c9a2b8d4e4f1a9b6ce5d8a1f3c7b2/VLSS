## Flashloan Fee and Swap Fee Imbalance

1. If the flashloan fee is lower than the swap fee, users may exploit this economic imbalance by repeatedly using flashloans for swaps, effectively bypassing swap fees to achieve the same outcome at a lower cost. This undermines the protocol’s revenue and reduces rewards for liquidity providers. To prevent this, the flashloan fee should be set equal to or higher than the swap fee.

2. `weighted_pool_tests` focuses on a specific, simple ratio/asset set utilizing a 50:50 weight and 2 assets, failing to reflect the diversity of real-world scenarios that the application may encounter. As a result of this narrow scope, complex conditions and edge cases remain untested.

## Remediation

Implement the above-mentioned suggestions.

## Patch

Fixed in `19dc5f1`.
