# [L-01] Admin Can Renounce with Active Blocklist

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The admin can call `renounce_admin()` while the blocklist remains enabled, setting the admin address to `@0x0`. Subsequently, inbound transfers to blocklisted addresses will be transferred to the zero address.

## Location of Affected Code

When `renounce_admin()` is called in `oapp_core.move`, the admin address is set to `@0x0`:

File: [sources/shared_oapp/oapp_core.move#L239](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_BRIDGE/blob/c68e1d39d98b2e819021384771a0bf4722ec5947/sources/shared_oapp/oapp_core.move#L239)

```rust
public entry fun renounce_admin(account: &signer) {
    let admin = address_of(move account);
    assert_admin(admin);
    oapp_store::set_admin(@0x0);
    emit(AdminTransferred { admin: @0x0 });
}
```

The blocklist functionality in `oft_impl_config.move` continues to operate normally, but the `redirect_to_admin_if_blocklisted()` function now returns `@0x0` for blocked recipients. Additionally, it is no longer possible to unblock those addresses.

File: [sources/shared_oft/oft_impl_config.move#L146](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_BRIDGE/blob/c68e1d39d98b2e819021384771a0bf4722ec5947/sources/shared_oft/oft_impl_config.move#L146)

```rust
public(friend) fun redirect_to_admin_if_blocklisted(recipient: address, amount_ld: u64): address acquires Config {
    if (!is_blocklisted(recipient)) {
        recipient
    } else {
        emit(BlockedAmountRedirected {
            amount_ld,
            blocked_address: recipient,
            redirected_to: get_admin(),  // Returns @0x0
        });
        get_admin()  // Returns @0x0
    }
}
```

## Impact

All transfers to blocklisted addresses will permanently be sent to `0x0`. Additionally, there is no way to unblock those addresses.

## Recommendation

Either disallow renounce when the blocklist is active, or automatically call `irrevocably_disable_blocklist()` internally on admin renounce.
