## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Comments for Getter Function**
   The comments for the getter function within `profile` incorrectly state that they perform an update operation instead of retrieving a value. For example, the comment for `watch_time` currently states the following:
   ```
// Updates the watch time for given profile.
   ```
   This is incorrect. Modify the comments to accurately describe the purpose of the getter functions.
   ```rust
   > _move/sources/profile.moverust
   // Updates the watch time for given profile.
   public fun watch_time(self: &Profile): &u64 {
       &self.watch_time
   }
   ```

2. **Inconsistent Access Level Range**
   In various parts of the module, the access level range is mentioned or asserted to be `[0, 250]`. However, the comments and assertions in some locations mention the range as `[0, 200]`. This creates inconsistency and ambiguity in understanding the permissible range of access levels. Ensure all comments, assertions, and logic related to the access level range are updated to utilize a consistent range throughout the module.

3. **Utilization of `is_valid_version`**
   Utilize `is_valid_version` for user-callable functions that change the state of the protocol.
