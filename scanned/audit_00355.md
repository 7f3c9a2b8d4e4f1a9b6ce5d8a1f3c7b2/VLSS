# Unauthorized Transfer Record Manipulation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Limiter Functionality and Security Concern

`limiter::check_and_record_sending_transfer` permits the addition of limiter records without executing an actual transfer, enabling invocation of this function with arbitrary input parameters, such as a large amount, without affecting any token transfer. This creates a loophole where transfer records may be manipulated without corresponding token movements, disrupting the system’s normal operation by hindering legitimate users from claiming tokens or conducting transfers within expected limits.

## Remediation

Limit the invocation of `check_and_record_sending_transfer` to authorized modules or components.

## Patch

Fixed in PR #17579.
