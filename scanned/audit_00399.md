# Inconsistencies In Object Creation

## Add Stop Functionality in Ride Management

The `add_stop` function creates a `Stop` object with the `duration` parameter and appends it to the `ride.stops` vector. However, it currently lacks cross-checking against existing stops, specifically concerning values like `stop_started` or `stop_ended`. Without proper validation, there is a risk that these values might conflict with other stops, resulting in unintended consequences during fare calculation or ride management.

## Code Snippet

```
drife_app.move RUST

public fun add_stop(
    rider: &Rider,
    ride: &mut Ride,
    duration: u64,
    traveled_distance: u64,
    traveled_time: u64
) {
    assert!(rider.rider_address == ride.rider, ERiderDoesNotMatchRide);
    assert!(vector::length(&ride.stops) < 5, ENotPossibleToAddMoreStops);
    vector::push_back(&mut ride.stops, duration);
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Implement cross-checking logic within `add_stop` to ensure that the new stop’s timing does not conflict with any existing stops in the `ride.stops` vector.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `5b4797c`.
