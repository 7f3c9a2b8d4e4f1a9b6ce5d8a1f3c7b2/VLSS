# Wormhole Deployment DOS

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Wormhole Module Initialization

During initialization of the wormhole module, it attempts to register an AptosCoin account in order to be able to receive fees:

```rust
wormhole/sources/wormhole.move
module wormhole::wormhole {
    ...
    fun init_internal(...) {
        ...
        coin::register<AptosCoin>(&wormhole);
    }
    ...
}
```

However, `coin::register` is a one-time operation. If `coin::register` has previously been called on this address, this initialization code will abort and the wormhole program will be unable to initialize. 

While it is usually not possible to register coins for users you cannot sign for, the Aptos framework provides a special mechanism to register AptosCoin for any user via `aptos_account::create_account`:

```rust
aptosaccount.move
public entry fun create_account(auth_key: address) {
    let signer = account::create_account(auth_key);
    coin::register<AptosCoin>(&signer);
}
```

Therefore, with this mechanism, an attacker could register AptosCoin for the wormhole program before deployment in order to prevent it from properly initializing.

## Remediation

Check if AptosCoin has been registered and conditionally invoke `coin::register` only if it hasn’t been registered.
