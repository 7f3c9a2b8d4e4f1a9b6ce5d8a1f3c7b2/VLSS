# Absence Of Rollup Status Check

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Bridge Tokens Implementation Issue

In the current implementation of the `bridge_tokens` instruction, there is no check to verify that the program is operating in an active rollup mode. If `bridge_tokens` is executed without checking if the rollup is active, it may result in unexpected errors, and the transaction would fail. Until the rollup is active, the receipt tokens will be stored in the contract, and they may be transferred only once the rollup is active.

## Remediation

Add a check to verify that the rollup is active before proceeding with bridging tokens.

## Patch

Resolved in `ce06685`.
