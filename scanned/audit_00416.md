## Issue Overview
The early return condition in `native_pool::stake_pool` may be exploited to withhold the staking of pending funds by retaining the `UnstakeTicket` objects.

```rust
native_pool.move
fun stake_pool(self: &mut NativePool, wrapper: &mut SuiSystemState, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let pending_value = coin::value(&self.pending);
    let tickets_supply = unstake_ticket::get_total_supply(&self.ticket_metadata);
    if (pending_value < tickets_supply) {
        return
    };
    // ...
}
```

## Remediation
The Volo team’s response clarifies that the design intention is to avoid staking the SUI that is slated for unstaking in the near future.
