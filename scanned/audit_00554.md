# Blocking User Funds In Kiosk

## Summary
The kiosk's extensions rely on the uid_mut function, but the current implementation may prevent its use by disabling extensions. This can cause users' funds to be locked when transferred to the extension. A solution is to create a fallback mechanism to improve the functionality of extensions. This issue has been resolved in a new version of the API.

## Details
## Kiosk Extensions and uid_mut Functionality

The concept of the kiosk’s extensions heavily depends on utilizing the `uid_mut` function. However, the current implementation may disallow the use of this function by calling `set_allow_extensions` with `allow_extensions` set to `false`. This may result in the locking of users’ funds that were transferred to the extension.

## Code Snippet

```rust
/// Get the mutable `UID` for dynamic field access and extensions.
/// Aborts if `allow_extensions` set to `false`.
public fun uid_mut(self: &mut Kiosk): &mut UID {
    assert!(self.allow_extensions, EExtensionsDisabled);
    &mut self.id
}
```

## Remediation

Implement a fallback mechanism that enables the termination of the extensions to enhance their functionality.

## Patch

This API is now deprecated, and this issue no longer exists.
