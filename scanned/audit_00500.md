# Edge Case In Auction Price Calculation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Auction Status and Remediation

The `status` function returns a boolean, which determines if the auction requires a reset, along with the current auction price.

With `DEFAULT_RESERVE_RATIO_BPS` being zero, in an edge case where the elapsed time equals `expiry_time_seconds`, the calculated price and `decrease_ratio` will be zero while the `below_reserve` will be false since `0 < 0` evaluates to false. 

Since a denominator in a formula in the bid uses the returned auction price, a division by zero error will occur and abort the process. This may be a critical issue if bidding is completed successfully with an auction price of `0`.

## Remediation

Change the condition in the `if` statement in `status` from:

```plaintext
(elapsed_seconds > params.expiry_time_seconds)
```

to:

```plaintext
(elapsed_seconds >= params.expiry_time_seconds)
```

## Patch

Fixed in #120.
