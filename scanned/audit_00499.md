# Additional Fields For Events In Oracle

## OracleParams Change Event

Whenever a value in `OracleParams` changes, the `OracleParamChangeEvent` event emits. However, the event fails to specify the coin name for which it changes the parameters. 

## Proposal

Add `coin_name` as a field in `OracleParamChangeEvent` to specify the coin for which the parameters are changed.

## Patch

Fixed in #111.
