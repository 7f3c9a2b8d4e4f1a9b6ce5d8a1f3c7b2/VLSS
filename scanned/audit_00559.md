# Bypass Id Leak Verifier

## Summary
The report discusses a bug in the id_leak_verifier function of the sui-verifier, which is responsible for ensuring that unique identifiers (UIDs) for Sui Objects are not reused. However, it has been found that this check can be bypassed using the unique Sui upgrade model. This is due to the ability to add new capabilities during an upgrade, the verifier not validating structures without a Key capability, and objects being passed between different versions of the same package. A proof of concept is provided, along with a suggested fix and a patch that has been implemented to address the issue.

## Details
## Sui Verifier: UID Non-Reusability

The `id_leak_verifier` in Sui Verifier ensures the non-reusability of a UID for the Sui Object. This step of the verifier guarantees that the `id` field of Sui objects never becomes leaked. However, a bypass of these checks may occur utilizing the unique Sui upgrade model. This issue arises due to the following factors:

1. It is possible to add abilities during an upgrade.
2. The verifier does not validate structures without a Key capability.
3. It is possible to pass objects between different versions of the same package.

## Proof of Concept

The provided file describes the issue through a Sui transaction test. The scenario is as follows:

1. Publish a module containing the `Bar` type without a Key capability, allowing the code to pack this type from any UID.
2. Upgrade the module, giving the `Bar` type a Key capability, while removing the Pack instruction from the code.
3. Construct a `Bar` instance using a reused UID with the old version of the module, and then pass it into the new version.
4. Notice that the last operation executes without any errors.

```

## Remediation

Introduce a new check during the upgrade mechanism to avoid adding a Key capability to an object.

## Patch

Fixed in `cbea73e`.
