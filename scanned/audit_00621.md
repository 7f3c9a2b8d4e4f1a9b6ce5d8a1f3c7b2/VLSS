# Semi-Fungible Token Support

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## NFT Bridge Limitations

The current NFT Bridge explicitly does not support semi-fungible tokens.

## Source Code

**File:** `sources/transfer_nft.move` (RUST)

```rust
// Instead, we just ensure that the NFT bridge can hold a maximum of
// 1 copy of this token. That is, even if the token has a supply
// larger than 1, only 1 of the tokens can be bridged out at any
// given time, so they effectively behave as NFTs outside of Aptos,
// even when they're technically fungible on Aptos.
assert!(token::balance_of(@nft_bridge, token_id) == 1,
,→ E_FUNGIBLE_TOKEN);
```

## Use Cases

After discussion with ecosystem teams, it appears that there are some use cases. For example, we encountered one team which was building a ticketing platform where individual tickets would be fungible across sections, but each section would be represented as an individual NFT.

## Remediation

Consider adding explicit support for semi-fungible tokens. For example, Wormhole could implement a nonce to make semi-fungible tokens fully non-fungible.
