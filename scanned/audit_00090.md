# [M-03] Attacker Can Desynchronize Supply Snapshot During Same-Block Unstake, Reducing Everyone’s Rewards

## Summary
This bug report discusses a vulnerability in the Cabal token contract that allows an attacker to manipulate the supply and reward distribution of the token. By initiating an unstake transaction in the same block as the manager's snapshot, the attacker can exploit flaws in the contract to artificially inflate the supply and reduce the total calculated reward shares. This results in a loss of rewards for all users and gives the attacker leverage to extort or grief other stakers. The report recommends two mitigation steps to fix the issue: adding a supply update to the `burn` function and fixing the `check_snapshot` function to ensure it always writes the user's balance for the current snapshot block.

### Finding description and impact

An attacker holding Cabal LSTs (like sxINIT) can monitor the mempool for the manager’s `voting_reward::snapshot()` transaction. By submitting his own `cabal::initiate_unstake` transaction to execute in the *same block* (`H`) as the manager’s snapshot, the attacker can use two flaws:

1. `cabal_token::burn` (called by their unstake) doesn’t update the supply snapshot for block `H`, leaving the recorded supply artificially high (pre-burn).
2. `cabal_token::check_snapshot` skips recording the attacker’s *own* balance for block `H`.
   Later reward calculations use the stale high supply but retrieve the attacker’s now lower (post-burn) balance via fallback logic. This desynchronization causes the total calculated reward shares to be less than 100%, reducing the rewards paid out to *all* users for that cycle.

**Attacker Exploit:**

1. **Manager Snapshots Supply:** `voting_reward::snapshot` triggers `cabal_token::snapshot`, recording the LST total supply (`S₀`) for block `H`.
2. **User Unstakes (Same Block H):** The user calls `cabal::initiate_unstake`.
3. Internally, `cabal_token::check_snapshot` is called but **skips writing** the user’s pre-burn balance for block `H` due to same-block logic.
4. The user’s live balance decreases.
5. `cabal_token::burn` executes, reducing the live supply, but **fails to update** the recorded supply snapshot for `H` (which remains `S₀`).
6. **Reward Calculation Uses Inconsistent State:** Later, rewards for cycle `H` are calculated:
7. `get_snapshot_supply(H)` returns the stale, **pre-burn `S₀`**.
8. `get_snapshot_balance(user, H)` finds no user snapshot for `H` and falls back, returning the user’s **live, post-burn balance**.
9. **Result:** The reward share calculation uses `post_burn_balance / pre_burn_supply`, causing the sum of all shares to be < 1, thus reducing payouts for everyone. An attacker triggers this by ensuring their `initiate_unstake` executes in the same block as the manager’s `snapshot` (e.g., via mempool monitoring).
```

// 1. In `cabal_token::burn` (called by attacker's `initiate_unstake` in block H)
public fun burn(burn_cap: &BurnCapability, fa: FungibleAsset) acquires ManagingRefs, HolderStore, ModuleStore { // Added missing acquires for context
    let metadata = burn_cap.metadata;
    let metadata_addr = object::object_address(&metadata);
    assert!(exists<ManagingRefs>(metadata_addr), EMANAGING_REFS_NOT_FOUND);
    let refs = borrow_global<ManagingRefs>(metadata_addr);

    // Burn reduces the LIVE supply
    fungible_asset::burn(&refs.burn_ref, fa);

    // --- VULNERABILITY PART 1 ---
    // ATTACKER EXPLOIT: This function is called in block H AFTER cabal_token::snapshot recorded
    // the supply. However, UNLIKE mint_to, this function DOES NOT check if it's the snapshot
    // block and DOES NOT update the HolderStore::supply_snapshots table for block H.
    // The recorded supply for H remains the stale, pre-burn value (S₀).
    /* Missing logic similar to mint_to:
        if (is_snapshot_block) {
            update supply_snapshots table with new (lower) supply S₁;
        }
    */
}

// 2. In `cabal_token::check_snapshot` (called during attacker's unstake in block H)
fun check_snapshot(c_balance: &mut CabalBalance, current_snapshot_block: u64, prev_snapshot_block: Option<u64>) {
    let current_block_height = block::get_current_block_height(); // Is H
    let snapshot_block = current_snapshot_block; // is H

    // --- VULNERABILITY PART 2 ---
    if (current_block_height == current_snapshot_block) { // TRUE (H == H)
        // ATTACKER EXPLOIT: This condition is met.The logic inside prevents writing
        // the attacker's PRE-BURN balance to their personal snapshot table for block H.
        if (option::is_none(&prev_snapshot_block)) {
            return; // Early return, no write for H
        };
        // Tries to write for Previous_H instead, still no write for H
        snapshot_block = option::extract(&mut prev_snapshot_block);
    };

    // The code path that writes `table::add(&mut c_balance.snapshot, key, c_balance.balance)`
    // requires `current_block_height > snapshot_block`, which is FALSE here.
    // RESULT: Attacker's balance for H is NOT recorded.
}

// 3. In `cabal_token::get_snapshot_balance_internal` (called during reward calculation for block H)
    fun get_snapshot_balance_internal(cabal_balance: &CabalBalance, block_height: u64): u64 { // block_height is H
    // ... start_block check ...

    // Search attacker's personal table for entry >= H
    let key = table_key::encode_u64(block_height);
    let iter = table::iter(&cabal_balance.snapshot, option::some(key), option::none(), 2);

    // --- VULNERABILITY PART 3 ---
    // Because the write was skipped (Vuln Part 2), no entry >= H is found for the attacker.
    if (!table::prepare<vector<u8>, u64>(iter)) {
        // ATTACKER EXPLOIT: Fallback logic returns the attacker's LIVE balance.
        // At this point (reward calculation time), the live balance is the POST-BURN balance.
        return cabal_balance.balance;
    };

    // This part is not reached for the attacker in this scenario
    let (_, balance) = table::next(iter);
    *balance
}
```

**Impact:**

* **Invariant violation**
  The attack breaks the core guarantee `Σ balances_H = supply_H`. Because the attacker’s balance is recorded *after* the burn while the supply is recorded *before*, the numerator shrinks but the denominator stays high.
* **Universal reward loss**
  Reward shares now sum to **< 1**, so the bribe contract distributes fewer tokens than were deposited. Every honest staker at snapshot H loses part of their yield; the missing amount remains stranded in the pool.
* **Direct leverage for the attacker**
  An exiting holder gives up only their own one‑cycle reward while slashing everyone else’s payout by the same absolute amount. They can repeat the manoeuvre each epoch—or threaten to—creating a zero‑cost grief / extortion vector.
* **Compromise of a core protocol function**
  Fair, supply‑proportional bribe distribution is a primary feature of Cabal. Desynchronising balances and supply corrupts that mechanism, undermining trust in the staking programme.
* **Irreversible cycle corruption**
  Once the snapshot for block H is polluted, the mis‑distribution for that cycle is permanent. users cannot reclaim the lost bribes without an invasive state migration.

### Recommended mitigation steps

1. **Add Supply Update to `burn`:** Modify `cabal_token::burn` to check if it’s executing in the same block as a snapshot. If so, update the `supply_snapshots` table for that block height with the new, lower supply *after* the burn, mirroring the logic in `cabal_token::mint_to`.
2. **Fix `check_snapshot`:** Ensure `check_snapshot` *always* writes the user’s pre-interaction balance for the current snapshot block `H` when needed, removing the logic that skips this write during same-block interactions.
