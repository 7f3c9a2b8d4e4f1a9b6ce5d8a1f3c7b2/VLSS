# Hardcoded Oracle Staleness Threshold

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> ORACLE_PRICE_MAX_AGE is not used on-chain to ensure the freshness of oracle prices, but rather as a final safeguard to confirm that the oracle provider is not down. When executing critical functions such as trade, liquidate, and deleverage, our operator will check the freshness of oracle prices and update the oracle price data. Currently, we only utilize the Pyth oracle, which fully leverages Pyth’s price update mechanism.

**File(s) affected:**`contracts/sources/library.move`

**Description:** The protocol uses a global constant `ORACLE_PRICE_MAX_AGE` of 60 seconds for all Pyth price feeds in `library::get_oracle_price()`. Different assets may have different update frequencies or network conditions. A single hardcoded value might be too strict for less liquid assets (causing transaction failures) or too loose for highly volatile assets.

**Recommendation:** Store the max age threshold in the `Perpetual` struct or `ProtocolConfig` to allow per-market configuration. Additionally, implement administrative functions to update this threshold, allowing operators to adjust it if the initial value proves too strict or too loose.
