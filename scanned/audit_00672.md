## Code Review: Unifying Collateral Ratio Checks in Argo

Argo currently uses a number of disjoint checks for each function that interacts with the collateral ratio.

### Existing Checks

In the `argo_engine/sources/engine_v1.move` file, we have the following checks:

```rust
assert!(
    withdraw_passes_initial_collateral_ratio_internal(engine, vault, amount),
    error::invalid_argument(ECOLLATERAL_RATIO_TOO_LOW),
);
```

```rust
assert!(
    mint_passes_minimum_debt_internal(engine, vault, amount),
    error::invalid_argument(EBELOW_MINIMUM_DEBT),
);
```

It would be cleaner to unify these checks by checking against the collateral ratio after the relevant operations.

### Proposed Patch

This issue has been resolved in commit `2c31c5c`. The new code in `argo_engine/sources/engine_v1.move` file is as follows:

```rust
// Check resulting debt is greater than the minimum debt and resulting
// collateral ratio is above the initial collateral ratio
assert!(
    scaled_debt_internal(engine, vault) >= engine.minimum_debt,
    error::invalid_argument(EBELOW_MINIMUM_DEBT),
);
``` 

This change consolidates the checks, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
