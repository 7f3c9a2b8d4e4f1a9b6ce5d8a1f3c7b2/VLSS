# Potential Denial Of Service In Pool

## Summary
The delegation_service has a limit on the number of direct delegators a pool can have, currently set at 100. However, a malicious user can exploit this by filling the list with fake delegators, preventing real delegators from staking. This can be combined with another issue, OS-TOR-PRO-01, to bypass the minimum delegation amount and leave small amounts in the pool, creating a free exploit. To fix this, it is recommended to allow all delegators to stake and implement a minimum delegation amount to ensure meaningful contributions. The issue has been fixed in version af0d61f.

## Details
## Delegation Service Vulnerability

In `delegation_service`, there is a hard limit on the number of direct delegators a pool may have:  
**MAX_NUMBER_OF_DELEGATIONS**, which currently equals **100**. 

A malicious user may fill the delegator list with fake delegators, staking small amounts to prevent real delegators from staking. In conjunction with **OS-TOR-PRO-01**, an attacker may bypass the `min_delegation_amount` and leave dust amounts in the pool, effectively making a free exploit.

## Remediation

Ensure that all delegators wishing to stake may stake to maximize efficiency for the validators. A `min_delegation_amount` imposed for the lifetime of the delegator’s funds helps ensure that all delegators are meaningfully contributing to the validator’s total stake. Consider implementing a fix for **OS-TOR-PRO-01** with this issue in mind.

## Patch

Fixed in **af0d61f**.
