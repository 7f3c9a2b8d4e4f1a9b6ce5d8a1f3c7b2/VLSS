## Risk of Cryptographic Signature Reuse in Placing Stop Orders Within Clearing House

There is a risk of cryptographic signature reuse in placing stop orders within Clearing House. Cryptographic signatures rely on a blend of order-specific details and a distinct random value termed **salt**, introducing unpredictability. Nonetheless, if the same salt is unintentionally or intentionally used again for generating signatures for diverse stop orders, it allows an observer to detect patterns and extract information about a user's specific stop orders, potentially compromising their privacy.

## Remediation

Integrate a table into Clearing House to store utilized signatures and validate their prior usage in `place_stop_order`.

## Patch

The Aftermath team has acknowledged this finding but chose not to patch as the exploit is dependent on specific administrative actions.
