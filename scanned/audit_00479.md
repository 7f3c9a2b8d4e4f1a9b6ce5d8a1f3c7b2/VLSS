# Unallocated Interest Remains Locked In Pool

## Updating State in Logic

In `logic.move`, `update_state` is used to update the value of `borrow_index`, `supply_index`, `last_timestamp`, and `treasury` in the Storage object. 

During calculations, the compound interest is subtracted from the borrower’s balances, while the linear interest is added to the supplier’s balances. However, no explicit allocation for the remaining amount exists, which would represent the difference between compound and linear interests. As a result, this remaining amount becomes locked in the pool.

## Remediation

Let the protocol collect the remaining amount as a fee instead of leaving it locked in the pool.
