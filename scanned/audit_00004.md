# Redundant Signature Verification on Order Cancellation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `f81c70f7e7ad18f925b52f2f38fbb56914d00534`.

**File(s) affected:**`order.move`

**Description:** The `cancel_order()` function verifies that the `creator` or a sub-account has created a valid signature (without replay protection). However, the function already verifies that the `creator` or a subaccount has submitted the order cancellation on-chain. As a result, the signature check does not add any security feature on top.

**Recommendation:** We recommend removing the signature verification.
