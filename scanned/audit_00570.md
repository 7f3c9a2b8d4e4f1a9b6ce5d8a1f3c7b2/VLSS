# Incorrect Event Function Visibility

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Events in events.move

The functions in `events.move` that emit events are set with public visibility. This allows anyone to call them, creating fake events.

## Rust Functions

```rust
public fun emit_created_pool_event<L>(
public fun emit_oracle_price_event<L, C1, C2>(
public fun emit_spot_price_event<L, C1, C2>(
public fun emit_deposit_event<L>(
public fun emit_withdraw_event<L>(
public fun emit_swap_event<L>(
```

## Remediation

Change the visibility of the functions from public to `public(friend)`.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `cd5ca7c`.
