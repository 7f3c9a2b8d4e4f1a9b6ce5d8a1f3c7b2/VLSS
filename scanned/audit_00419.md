## Protocol Termination Due to Math::Ratio Overflow

The commonly utilized `math::ratio` may abruptly terminate if the ratio surpasses `RATIO_MAX`. This may result in a situation where the protocol becomes inoperable.

## Code Example

```rust
public fun ratio(supply: u64, tvl: u64): u256 {
    if (tvl == 0) {
        // if we don't have tvl ratio is max
        return RATIO_MAX;
    };
    let ratio = (supply as u256) * RATIO_MAX / (tvl as u256);
    assert!(ratio <= RATIO_MAX, E_RATIO_OVERFLOW);
    ratio
}
```

## Remediation

Substitute the `assert!()` call with a conditional check and the subsequent return of an error code. Alternatively, it is advised to consider implementing functionality that permits the correction of the ratio in such cases.

## Patch

The Volo team emphasizes that in the event of such an occurrence, the protocol should not be utilized until the problem is resolved. The team has indicated that this may be achieved by updating the code or adjusting the rewards.
