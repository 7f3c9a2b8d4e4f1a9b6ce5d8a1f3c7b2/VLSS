Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `1050ac699364a3b79a85a9f84ba860e632dc11ae`.

**File(s) affected:**`vault.move`

**Description:** The `request_withdraw()` function currently calls `update_share_price()` even though `vault.last_share_price` is not required for its operation. Updating the vault share price involves constructing a `VaultNAV` and performing expensive calculations, which unnecessarily increases gas costs for users.

**Recommendation:** Consider removing both the `nav` parameter from `request_withdraw()` and the call to `update_share_price()` within its implementation to reduce computational overhead.
