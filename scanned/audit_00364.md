# Frontrunning Deployment Process

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Factory::deploy Overview

In `Factory::deploy`, a new pool contract is deployed utilizing a deployer. The admin and salt parameters are provided as function arguments. On observing a deployment of a transaction with a specific salt, another user may front-run by deploying their pool contract with the same salt but a different admin address, disrupting the original user's deployment process.

## Remediation

Ensure that the same salt with a different admin results in a different deployer address.

## Patch

Fixed in `8556fc0b` by deriving the salt from the admin.
