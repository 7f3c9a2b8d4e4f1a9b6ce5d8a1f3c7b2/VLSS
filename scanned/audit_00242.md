## Update Swap Fee BPS in MemeConfig

The function `meme::update_swap_fee_bps` allows an admin to update the `swap_fee_bps` parameter of the `MemeConfig` structure. However, it currently lacks any check to limit the maximum value of `swap_fee_bps`. Thus, it is possible to set it to more than 10000 bps (more than 100%). If an admin sets the swap fee to an excessively high value, users attempting to perform swaps will receive no tokens in return, resulting in a loss of their funds.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun update_swap_fee_bps(
    _cap: &AdminCap,
    config: &mut MemeConfig,
    swap_fee_bps: u64,
) {
    config.swap_fee_bps = swap_fee_bps;
}
```

## Remediation

Add a validation check in `update_swap_fee_bps` to ensure that `swap_fee_bps` does not exceed the predefined threshold of 10000 bps.
