# Lack of Token Unfreeze Functionality

## Staking Implementation Review

The current implementation of staking has functionality to freeze the coin stores of thAPT tokens for a list of specified account addresses via `freeze_thapt_coin_stores`. However, there is an absence of a corresponding unfreeze function which may result in a loss of liquidity, as users will be unable to access their tokens, preventing them from utilizing them.

```rust
public entry fun freeze_thapt_coin_stores(manager: &signer, account_addresses: vector<address>) acquires TLSD {
    assert!(manager::is_authorized(manager), ERR_TLSD_UNAUTHORIZED);
    let freeze_cap = &borrow_global<TLSD>(package::resource_account_address()).thAPT_freeze_capability;
    vector::for_each(account_addresses, |account_address| {
        coin::freeze_coin_store(account_address, freeze_cap);
    })
}
```

## Remediation

Introduce a function such as `unfreeze_thapt_coin_stores` that reverses the freezing action.

## Patch

Fixed in commit **5ba884a**.
