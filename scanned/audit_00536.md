## CapyLabsApp Configuration and Remediation

In `genesis.move`, a new `CapyLabsApp` is created and configured with the default value during initialization. However, changing the `mixing_limit` field in the contract is impossible. A user with `AdminCap` privileges should be able to modify its value using a helper function.

```rust
sources/capy_labs.move

fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let id = object::new(ctx);
    let inner_hash = hash(&object::uid_to_bytes(&id));
    let app = CapyLabsApp {
        id,
        inner_hash,
        mixing_limit: DEFAULT_MIXING_LIMIT,
        cool_down_period: DEFAULT_COOL_DOWN_PERIOD_IN_EPOCHS,
        mixing_price: DEFAULT_MIXING_PRICE,
        profits: balance::zero<SUI>()
    };
    transfer::share_object(app)
}
```

In `accessories.move` and `badges.move`, users may mint new objects, but they are unable to be deleted once created.

## Remediation

Introduce the following:
1. A new admin function that allows changing the value of `mixing_limit` in `capy_labs.move`.
2. New functions to delete minted objects and refund payments in `accessories.move` and `badges.move`.

## Patch

The first remediation recommendation has been addressed in commit `a1a74d6`.
