# Limited withdraw capabilities

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Juiced Protocol Yield Generation

In order to generate yield, the Juiced protocol deposits funds into Mango and Mercurial. However, this means that users can only withdraw up to the amount currently held in the sweeper vault. During periods of large withdrawal, the carton may not be able to service every request.

## Remediation

If the sweeper vault’s balance dips below a certain threshold, the Juiced backend should move back assets from Mango and Mercurial. Alternatively, one could modify the on-chain program to automatically CPI into these programs, if necessary during withdrawal.
