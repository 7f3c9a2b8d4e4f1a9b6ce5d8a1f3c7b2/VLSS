## Issue Summary

In the `bit_math` module, the comment in `closest_non_zero_bit` is incorrect. It states that `MAX_U256` is returned if there is no closest bit; however, the hard-coded value equal to `MAX_U16` is returned from `closest_non_zero_bit` in the absence of a closest bit. Therefore, it should refer to `MAX_U16`.

## Affected Code

File: `math_helpers/sources/bit_math.move`

```move
/// Returns the closest non-zero bit of `x` to the right (or left) of the `bit`
/// bits that is not `bit`
/// Returns the index of the closest non-zero bit. If there is no closest bit,
/// it returns MAX_U256
///
/// It's more clear to use Option<u8> but Option represented by vector and
/// consumes more bits.
public fun closest_non_zero_bit(x: u256, curr_bit_index: u8, right: bool): u16
{
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Change the comment in `bit_math::closest_non_zero_bit`, replacing `MAX_U256` with `MAX_U16`.
