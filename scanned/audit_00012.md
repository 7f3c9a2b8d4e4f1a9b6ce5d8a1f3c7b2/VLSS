Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `3b3b82a1416250f7394a5767b4a23f4ba94160bc`.

**File(s) affected:**`bank.move`

**Description:** When users call `withdraw_all()`, some dust will remain in the contract that can never be withdrawn. The dust accrues due to the fact that 3 decimals of precision are removed. While the dust is negligible for a single user operation, dust may accumulate over time.

**Recommendation:** We recommend removing the rounding and working with asset-specific decimals.
