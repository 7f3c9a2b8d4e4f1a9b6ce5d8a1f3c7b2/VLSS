# [Initia] Discrepancy Between the Implementation of `accrue_pool_reward` Across Different Branches

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `268b163`. Fixed as per recommendation.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/farming.move`

**Description:** A small change in the `accrue_pool_reward` function within the Initia branch can significantly affect protocol behavior. In the main branch, this function updates `pool_reward.last_rewards_sec` by setting it to the current time if `alloc_point` is 0 before returning. However, in the Initia branch, the function returns early if `alloc_point` is 0 without updating `pool_reward.last_rewards_sec`.

This can lead to a scenario where, after the first update of `alloc_point`, the next call to this function considers the new `alloc_point` for the entire duration from the pool's start until the moment of the call, rather than only from when the `alloc_point` was updated.

**Recommendation:** Consider determining the intended behavior and refactoring the code in either the Initia branch or the main branch to ensure consistent behavior across both.
