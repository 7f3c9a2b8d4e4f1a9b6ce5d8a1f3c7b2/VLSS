# Test Case Implementation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Audit Findings

Over the course of the audit, several instances were identified where functions failed to update an object, or conditions that consistently evaluated to false. Additionally, multiple cases were found concerning missing verifications and a lack of checks to validate the current state of the object before modification. 

Therefore, it is advisable to implement end-to-end and unit tests to identify such issues, especially given the discovery of numerous similar issues. The creation of a comprehensive test suite would enhance the robustness and efficiency of the code.

## Remediation

Ensure to integrate unit and end-to-end test cases into the current application.
