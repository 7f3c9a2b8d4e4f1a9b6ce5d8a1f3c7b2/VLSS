## Threshold Requirement in Signature Validation

The threshold represents the minimum combined weight required from validators to approve a message. Each validator in the signers set has an associated weight, which signifies its voting power or influence. 

Thus, in `validate_signatures`, if the threshold is zero, it means any number of signatures, regardless of the validators’ weights, will be sufficient for approval.

```plaintext
> _axelar_gateway/sources/auth.moverust
```

```rust
fun validate_signatures(
    message: vector<u8>,
    signers: &WeightedSigners,
    signatures: &vector<Signature>,
) {
    [...]
    while (i < signatures_length) {
        [...]
        total_weight = total_weight + signers.signers()[signer_index].weight()
        if (total_weight >= threshold) {
            return
        };
        [...]
    }
    abort ELowSignaturesWeight
}
```

This effectively bypasses the intended security mechanism of requiring a minimum level of consensus from validators with voting power. A threshold greater than zero ensures that only a certain level of combined weight from validators is sufficient for approval. This helps prevent unauthorized modifications or actions even if some signatures are compromised.

## Remediation
Ensure the threshold is greater than zero within `validate_signatures`.

## Patch
Fixed in PR #57.
