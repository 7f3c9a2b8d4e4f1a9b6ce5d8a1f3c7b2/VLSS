# Comprehensive Application Security Review of Front-End System

## Summary
The report states that Thala's front-end system has not undergone a comprehensive security review, making it vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site scripting, logic manipulation, and phishing. This is concerning because the system handles sensitive data and interacts with backend services. The report also mentions previous risks and vulnerabilities identified in the system, highlighting the need for a thorough security assessment. The impact of these vulnerabilities is high, as they could compromise user trust, funds, or system integrity. The report recommends conducting a comprehensive security review of the front-end system, focusing on code quality, client-side logic, security controls, dependency security, and penetration testing.

## Details
## Severity: Medium Risk

## Description
Thala’s front-end system has not undergone a comprehensive application security (AppSec) review. This system handles user interactions, displays sensitive data, and integrates with backend services, making it a prime target for attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), client-side logic manipulation, or phishing exploits. Without a thorough assessment, latent vulnerabilities could persist, increasing the risk of exploitation that could compromise user trust, funds, or system integrity.

The absence of a prior AppSec review is notable given:
- Dependency management risks identified in M-05, which are only one aspect of front-end security.
- Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP) noted in L-06, suggesting broader front-end security gaps may exist.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in an API route (L-05), highlighting potential weaknesses in systems interacting with the front-end.

## Severity Discussion
The impact is high, as front-end vulnerabilities could enable attackers to steal user credentials, inject malicious content, or disrupt protocol operations. The likelihood is medium, as no specific exploits have been identified, but the system’s exposure to external users and lack of prior review elevate the risk. This ranks as a medium-severity issue, warranting proactive mitigation.

## Recommendation
Conduct a comprehensive application security (AppSec) review of the front-end system, focusing on:
- **Code Quality:** Assess for secure coding practices, input validation, and output encoding to prevent XSS, CSRF, and injection flaws.
- **Client-Side Logic:** Verify that business logic cannot be bypassed or manipulated by attackers.
- **Security Controls:** Evaluate implementation of CSP (see L-06), secure headers, and session management.
- **Dependency Security:** Expand on M-06 to ensure all libraries are vetted and up-to-date.
- **Penetration Testing:** Consider pen testing to simulate real-world attacks in order to identify exploitable weaknesses.
