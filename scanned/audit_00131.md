## Details
**Update**
The client provided the following explanation:

> not a concern

**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/lending.move`, `isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** Different object accounts, such as `JumpInterestRateModel`, `MarketLiquidationThreshold`, `MarketLiquidationIncentive`, `MarketLiquidationPauseFlag`, `CoinInfo`, and `FungibleAssetInfo`, in various places are moved to global storage with the same `market_signer` object identifier. However, objects should be isolated to different accounts; otherwise, modifications to one object within an account can influence the entire collection.

**Recommendation:** Consider creating a new object reference for each struct and using the reference to generate a new address for each. For more information, refer to [Aptos official recommendation](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/move-security-guidelines#object-accounts).
