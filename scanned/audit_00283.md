# Usage of legacy Coin standard

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
##### Description

Following [AIP-63](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-63.md), the Aptos team is transitioning from the `Coin` standard to the `Fungible Asset` (FA) standard. It's advisable to adopt the FA standard from the outset to circumvent potential migration complexities post-contract deployment.

Code Location
-------------

The `protocol_reward` module uses the legacy `Coin` standard:

```
use aptos_framework::coin::{Self, Coin};
```

```
struct Reward<phantom AssetType> has store {
    registered_at: u64,
    registered_reward_amount: u64,
    coin: Coin<AssetType>
}
```

```
let reward = coin::extract(&mut reward.coin, reward_amount);
```

```
coin: coin::withdraw<AssetType>(_admin, _amount)
```

```
aptos_account::deposit_coins(address_of(_admin), coin::extract_all(&mut reward.coin));
coin::merge(&mut reward.coin, coin::withdraw<AssetType>(_admin, _amount));
```

##### Recommendation

Consider using the Fungible Asset (FA) standard instead of the legacy Coin standard.

Remediation Plan
----------------

**ACKNOWLEDGED:** The **Taurus Labs team** acknowledged this issue but decided against fixing it considering their plan to distribute rewards in `zUSDC`, which is a USD Coin bridged to `Aptos` by `LayerZero`.
