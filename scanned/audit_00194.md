## Issues Identified

1. **Delay Value Validation**
   - Include the assertion:
     ```rust
     assert!(delay_ms == MS_24_HOURS || delay_ms == MS_48_HOURS)
     ```
     with the `EInvalidDelayValue` error in `new_timelock` to validate that the provided delay value is one of the allowed options (24 hours or 48 hours).
     
     > _File: timelock_policy/sources/timelock_upgrade.move_
     ```rust
     /// Creates a new TimelockCap with the specified delay.
     public fun new_timelock(
         upgrade_cap: UpgradeCap,
         delay_ms: u64,
         ctx: &mut TxContext,
     ): TimelockCap {
         TimelockCap {
             id: object::new(ctx),
             upgrade_cap,
             last_authorized_time: 0,
             delay_ms,
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Public Key Validation in Treasury**
   - In `treasury`, verify the length of the `pks` vector elements to ensure that each element of `pks` is a valid public key before it is utilized in the multisig address validation.

3. **Amount Validation in Minting and Burning Operations**
   - The `mint_and_transfer` and `burn` functions in `treasury` do not validate whether the amount is greater than zero, which affects the correctness of these operations. Allowing zero-value minting or burning is unnecessary, wastes computational resources, and adds noise to event logs. Add validation to ensure:
     - In `burn`: `if coin.value() > 0`
     - In `mint_and_transfer`: `if amount > 0`

## Remediation
Incorporate the above-mentioned validations into the codebase.
