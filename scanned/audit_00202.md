# Initialization Price Validation

## Summary

## Analysis of `tick_math::get_tick_at_sqrt_price`

In `tick_math::get_tick_at_sqrt_price`, utilizing `<=` implies that the pool may be initialized at `max_sqrt_price`. However, `max_tick` represents an area that should remain unreachable. Thus, allowing initialization at `max_sqrt_price` effectively opens up the possibility for the pool to operate at extreme prices.

```move
> _ sources/maths/tick_math.move move
public fun get_tick_at_sqrt_price(sqrt_price: u128): i32::I32 {
    assert!(sqrt_price >= MIN_SQRT_PRICE_X64 && sqrt_price <= MAX_SQRT_PRICE_X64, EINVALID_SQRT_PRICE);
    let r = sqrt_price;
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Include validation during the pool creation process to ensure that the initial `sqrt_price` falls within a safe and operational range.

## Patch

Resolved in `f9025e9`.
