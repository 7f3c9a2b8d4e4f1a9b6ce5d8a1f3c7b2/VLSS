> This is a solution we have discussed after careful deliberation. We believe this solution is safer than opening up liquidation permissions, because the insurance fund can accumulate positive premiums, thereby having more capital to resist the directional risk . Under the solution you proposed, the insurance fund only takes over insolvent positions; the directional risk still remain, and the insurance fund is exposed to higher risks.

**File(s) affected:**`exchange.move`, `isolated_liquidation.move`

**Description:** The protocol routes all liquidations through the insurance fund, which takes over positions and relies on an off-chain automated engine to close them via regular trades. This differs from industry-standard perpetual DEXs (GMX, dYdX, Hyperliquid) where liquidations are matched against orderbook liquidity first, with insurance funds only absorbing unmatched bad debt. Under the insurance-first design, market makers never see liquidation flow, potentially disadvantaging them compared to traditional orderbook-first systems. The insurance fund accumulates directional risk whenever liquidation closures lag behind new liquidations, even during normal volatility when orderbook liquidity exists.

The team's rationale centers on concerns about thin orderbook liquidity, and their off-chain engine is designed to immediately match insurance positions against the orderbook. However, this creates a critical operational dependency where the insurance fund becomes the required intermediary for all liquidations rather than a last-resort backstop. If the off-chain engine experiences delays (network congestion, orderbook depth constraints), the insurance fund accumulates positions and directional exposure that would otherwise be absorbed directly by market makers.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing hybrid liquidation where liquidations with positive premiums (remaining equity) can be executed permissionlessly by external liquidators competing for the premium, while only negative premium liquidations (bad debt) route through the insurance fund. This would align incentives with industry standards, reduce unnecessary directional risk for the insurance fund, and provide market makers access to liquidation flow.
