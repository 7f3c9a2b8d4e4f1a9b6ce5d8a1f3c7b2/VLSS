# [L-07] Missing the function to transfer the `AdminCap` object

The `AdminCap` is the protocol’s privilege credential. It is created in the `init` function and transferred to the sender. 
```rust
public struct AdminCap has key {
    id: UID,
}
```
However, the `AdminCap` object only has the `key` ability, which means it cannot be freely transferred via `public_transfer` outside the module. Moreover, there is no function within the module that allows the `AdminCap` holder to transfer ownership. This indicates that the functionality for owner transfer is missing.

It is recommended to add a function to transfer the ownership of the `AdminCap` in the `admin_cap` module.
