# Denial of Service via Mint Limit Exhaustion

## Summary
The bug report discusses an issue with the claim_native and return_native functions in the bridge, which allow users to swap wrapped tokens for native tokens and vice versa. However, an attacker can exploit this by repeatedly swapping a small amount of tokens between minting and burning, leading to the exhaustion of the treasury's capacity. The suggested solution is to remove the ability for users to wrap and unwrap tokens within the same chain and instead force them to go cross-chain, which should slow down such attacks. This issue has been resolved in the patch with the code a58183d.

## Details
## Token Swap Vulnerability

`claim_native` and `return_native` in bridge allow users to swap wrapped tokens (WT) for native tokens and vice versa. However, an attacker can repeatedly cycle a small token amount between minting (`claim_native`) and burning (`return_native`). Since each minting operation contributes to the epoch’s minting limit, this exploitation will exhaust the treasury’s capacity within an epoch, preventing legitimate users from minting new tokens.

## Remediation

Remove the ability for the user to wrap and unwrap purely inside Sui and force them to go cross-chain, which should significantly slow down such an attack.

## Patch

Resolved in `a58183d`.
