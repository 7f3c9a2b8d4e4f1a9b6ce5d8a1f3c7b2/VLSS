# Incorrect Liquidity Calculation

## Summary
The function get_borrow_rate is currently calculating the utilization ratio and interest rates incorrectly, resulting in lower interest rates for borrowers. This is due to an incorrect calculation of total_liquidity, which includes the reserve_amount instead of subtracting it. This leads to an overestimation of total_liquidity and a lower utilization ratio. As a result, borrowers are being charged a lower interest rate than intended. To fix this issue, the decimal::add function should be changed to decimal::sub in the calculation of total_liquidity. This will ensure an accurate utilization ratio and appropriate interest rate calculations. The bug has been fixed in the latest patch.

## Details
## Issue with `get_borrow_rate`

The issue in `get_borrow_rate` may result in miscalculated utilization ratios and lower interest rates for borrowers than intended. The function currently calculates `total_liquidity` by adding the `reserve_amount` (unborrowed reserve funds) to the sum of `total_borrowed` and `decimal::from_u128(total_cash)`, which is incorrect. The utilization ratio is calculated by dividing `total_borrowed` by `total_liquidity`. With the incorrect calculation, the `total_liquidity` is overestimated because the `reserve_amount` is added instead of subtracted, lowering the utilization ratio.

```rust
> _interest_rate_config.move
public fun get_borrow_rate(
    config: &InterestRateConfig,
    total_borrowed: Decimal,
    total_cash: u128,
    reserve_amount: Decimal,
): Decimal {
    if (decimal::eq(total_borrowed, decimal::zero())) {
        return decimal::zero()
    };
    let total_liquidity = decimal::add(
        total_borrowed,
        decimal::add(reserve_amount, decimal::from_u128(total_cash))
    );
    [...]
}
```

The utilization ratio determines the borrow rate. A lower utilization ratio calculated due to the flawed formula would incorrectly imply that the reserve is less utilized than it actually is. This will result in a lower borrow rate being charged to borrowers compared to what it should be based on the true utilization level.

## Remediation

Change the `decimal::add` to `decimal::sub` in the calculation of `total_liquidity`. This will ensure the `reserve_amount` is subtracted, resulting in an accurate utilization ratio and appropriate borrow rate calculations.

## Patch

Fixed in `7564ea2`.
