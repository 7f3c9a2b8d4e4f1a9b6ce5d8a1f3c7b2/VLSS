# [08] Contradictory `base_path` existence check in clean command

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
While not directly causing failures, it indicates a flaw in the logic flow and could mask other issues.

### Proof of concept

<https://github.com/initia-labs/movevm/blob/7096b76ba9705d4d932808e9c80b72101eafc0a8/crates/compiler/src/clean.rs# L100-L103>
```

if !base_path.exists() || !build_path.exists() {
    return Ok(());
}
```

In the `validate_manifest` function of the Move VM’s clean command, there is a contradiction where it checks for the non-existence of the base path (`!base_path.exists()`) after already having used this path to verify and read the `Move.toml` file. We’ve already used `base_path` to find and read the `Move.toml` file earlier in the function. If `base_path` doesn’t exist, the function would have already failed at the manifest check.

This condition would never be true for `base_path` since we’ve already confirmed its existence by reading the manifest from it.

### Recommended mitigation steps

Remove the redundant base path check and only verify the build path existence:
```

// Replace this:
if !base_path.exists() || !build_path.exists() {
    return Ok(());
}

// With this:
if !build_path.exists() {
    return Ok(());
}
```
