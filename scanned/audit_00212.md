# Missing Approval Removal Function

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Approve Spending Permissions in ds_token

The `ds_token::approve` function allows an investor to grant spending permissions to another address (spender). However, there is no direct way to withdraw or remove this approval from the allowances list. Instead, the only option is to reset the approval amount to zero.

## Remediation

To address this issue, add a function to revoke any given spender’s permission by deleting their entry from the allowances list altogether.

## Patch

This issue has been resolved in commit `06538b8`.
