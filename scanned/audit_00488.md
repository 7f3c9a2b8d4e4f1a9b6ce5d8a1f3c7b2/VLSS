# Inappropriate Transfer Of Zero-Value Coins

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Using `Inutils.move`: The `split_coin` Function

The `split_coin` function is used for splitting a specified amount from a Coin object. The function returns the extracted part while the remaining part transfers back to the user. However, it fails to handle the scenario where the remaining coins after the split equal zero, leading to an unnecessary transfer of zero-value coins.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun split_coin<CoinType>(split_coin: Coin<CoinType>, amount: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext): Coin<CoinType> {
    // get total value of coin
    let coin_value = coin::value(&split_coin);
    assert!(amount > 0, UTILS_AMOUNT_ZERO);
    assert!(coin_value >= amount, UTILS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS);

    // Split the specified amount of coin
    let split_ = coin::split(&mut split_coin, amount, ctx);

    // Transferring the unsegmented portion back to the user
    transfer::public_transfer(split_coin, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    split_
}
```

## Remediation

Include a check to verify that after a coin splits, the remaining amount is above zero. If the remaining amount is zero, `destroy_zero` should be invoked instead of performing an unnecessary transfer of zero-value coins.
