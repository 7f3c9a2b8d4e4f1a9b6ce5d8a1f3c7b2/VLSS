# Insufficient sanity check for add_to_whitelist

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract token_vesting.move, in function `add_to_whitelist` there are no sanity checks for the whitelist_address and whitelist_amount vectors, there is one check that is making sure the vectors have the same length, however both of the vectors could have length 0 which will break the function invariant as this function will execute successful but the store will not be modified in any way.

**Recommendation**: 

Add sanity checks to make sure that the arrays are not empty..
