## Code Review: UID Generation in `converter.move`

During `new_id` in `converter.move`, a new UID is generated and then deleted after the `new_id` creation. This step is unnecessary and may be replaced by invoking `tx_context::fresh_object_address`.

## Code Snippet

```rust
source/controller/controller.move RUST
public(friend) fun new_id(ctx: &mut TxContext): ID {
    let new_uid = object::new(ctx);
    let new_id = object::uid_to_inner(&new_uid);
    object::delete(new_uid);
    new_id
}
```

## Remediation

Replace the step by invoking `tx_context::fresh_object_address` instead.
