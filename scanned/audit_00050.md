# [L-02] Maximum Fee Cap Allows 100% Fees

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In `sources/shared_oft/oft_impl_config.move`, the `MAX_FEE_BPS` constant is set to `10,000` basis points (100%), allowing the admin to configure fees that would completely confiscate user transfers, which is an unreasonable upper bound for a transfer fee.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [sources/shared_oft/oft_impl_config.move#L47-L52](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_BRIDGE/blob/c68e1d39d98b2e819021384771a0bf4722ec5947/sources/shared_oft/oft_impl_config.move#L47-L52)

```rust
const MAX_FEE_BPS: u64 = 10_000;

public(friend) fun set_fee_bps(fee_bps: u64) acquires Config {
    assert!(fee_bps <= MAX_FEE_BPS, EINVALID_FEE);
    assert!(fee_bps != store().fee_bps, ESETTING_UNCHANGED);
    store_mut().fee_bps = fee_bps;
    emit(FeeSet { fee_bps });
}
```

## Impact

While technically the admin could set any fee below 100%, such a cap provides no protection against misconfiguration or malicious admin behavior. Standard practice in DeFi protocols is to cap fees at reasonable levels (typically 5-20%).

## Recommendation

Reduce `MAX_FEE_BPS` to a reasonable maximum, such as `2,000` (20%) or `500` (5%).
