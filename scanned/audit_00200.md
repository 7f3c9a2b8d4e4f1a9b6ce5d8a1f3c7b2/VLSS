## Validation Guidelines for Liquidity Functions

1. **Function Checks**  
   In the following functions:  
   - `add_liquidity`  
   - `add_liquidity_with_fixed_amount`  
   - `remove_liquidity`  
   - `swap`  
   - `flash_swap`  

   check that the amount passed is greater than zero. Allowing zero amounts to be passed into these functions will result in nonsensical operations.

2. **Fee Rate and Tick Spacing Limits**  
   Limit the values of `fee_rate` and `tick_spacing` to an acceptable range in `pool::new`. A high fee rate will discourage users from providing liquidity or trading within the pool. Additionally, if `tick_spacing` is set too small, it may result in inefficient liquidity distribution, rendering it difficult for traders to execute orders at desired prices.

3. **Version Validation**  
   In `admin::update_supported_version`, add a validation to ensure the incremented `config.version` does not exceed the latest version.

## Remediation  
Incorporate the above validations.
