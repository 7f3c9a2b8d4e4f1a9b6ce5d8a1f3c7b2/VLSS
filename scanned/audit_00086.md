# [M-07] Desynchronization of Cabal’s internal accounting with actual staked INIT amounts leads to over-minting of sxINIT tokens

## Summary
This bug report outlines a problem with the Cabal Protocol's implementation of the `compound_xinit_pool_rewards` function. This function fails to synchronize the protocol's internal accounting with the actual amount of INIT tokens staked in the underlying Initia staking system. This creates a vulnerability where external events, such as slashing penalties, are not reflected in the protocol's internal state, leading to economic dilution and potential systemic risk. The recommended mitigation step is to modify the function to query the actual staked amounts after claiming rewards.

### Summary

The Cabal Protocol’s implementation of `compound_xinit_pool_rewards` fails to synchronize the protocol’s internal accounting (`m_store.staked_amounts`) with the actual amount of INIT tokens staked in the underlying Initia staking system. This creates a vulnerability where external events like slashing penalties or validator-initiated actions that reduce the staked amount are not reflected in Cabal’s internal state. The reward compounding function simply adds claimed rewards to its internal tracking variable without verifying that this matches reality, creating a divergence between what Cabal thinks is staked and what actually is staked. When slashing occurs, users who stake xINIT will receive more sxINIT than they should based on the actual backing ratio. This leads to economic dilution of all sxINIT holders.

This issue is particularly concerning because it compounds over time - each slashing event that goes unaccounted for widens the gap between reported and actual values, eventually leading to significant economic damage for the protocol and its users.

**Technical Explanation**

The core issue lies in the `compound_xinit_pool_rewards` function in `cabal.move`, which is responsible for claiming staking rewards and updating the protocol’s internal state:
```

fun compound_xinit_pool_rewards(m_store: &mut ModuleStore, pool_index: u64) {
    let coin_metadata = coin::metadata(@initia_std, string::utf8(b"uinit"));
    let reward_fa = pool_router::withdraw_rewards(coin_metadata);
    let reward_amount = fungible_asset::amount(&reward_fa);

    if (reward_amount > 0) {
        // calculate fee amount
        let fee_ratio = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u64(m_store.xinit_stake_reward_fee_bps, BPS_BASE);
        let fee_amount = bigdecimal::mul_by_u64_truncate(fee_ratio, reward_amount);
        let fee_fa = fungible_asset::extract(&mut reward_fa, fee_amount);
        let rewards_remaining = reward_amount - fee_amount;
        primary_fungible_store::deposit(package::get_commission_fee_store_address(), fee_fa);

        m_store.stake_reward_amounts[pool_index] = m_store.stake_reward_amounts[pool_index] + rewards_remaining;
        pool_router::add_stake(reward_fa);

        // mint xINIT to pool
        m_store.staked_amounts[pool_index] = m_store.staked_amounts[pool_index] + rewards_remaining;
        coin::mint_to(&m_store.x_init_caps.mint_cap, package::get_assets_store_address(), rewards_remaining);
    } else {
        fungible_asset::destroy_zero(reward_fa);
    }
}
```

The issue occurs because this function:

1. Claims rewards from the staking system via `pool_router::withdraw_rewards`
2. Processes these rewards and restakes them via `pool_router::add_stake`
3. Updates `m_store.staked_amounts[pool_index]` by simply adding the rewards amount
4. Never verifies that this updated value matches the actual staked amount in the underlying system

However, the protocol has a function `pool_router::get_real_total_stakes` that does query the actual staked amount from the Initia staking system:
```

// From pool_router.move
pub fun get_real_total_stakes(metadata: Object<Metadata>): u64 {
    // Sum up all stake amounts from the underlying staking system
    let total_stakes: u64 = 0;
    /* ... */
    let pools = *simple_map::borrow(&router.token_pool_map, &metadata);

    for (i in 0..vector::length(&pools)) {
        let amount = if (metadata == utils::get_init_metadata()) {
            get_init_real_stakes(&pools[i])
        } else {
            get_lp_real_stakes(&pools[i])
        };
        total_stakes = total_stakes + amount;
    };

    total_stakes
}
```

This function is never called during reward compounding, leading to the desynchronization.

**The following scenario demonstrates how this vulnerability can lead to over-minting of sxINIT tokens:**

1. Initial state:

   * 1,000,000,000 INIT staked in the Initia staking system
   * `m_store.staked_amounts[0]` = 1,000,000,000
   * Total sxINIT supply = 1,000,000,000
2. A slashing event occurs in the Initia staking system, reducing the staked INIT by 5%:

   * Actual staked INIT = 950,000,000
   * `m_store.staked_amounts[0]` still = 1,000,000,000 (unchanged)
3. Rewards of 50,000,000 INIT are claimed via `compound_xinit_pool_rewards`:

   * Function adds 50,000,000 to `m_store.staked_amounts[0]`, making it 1,050,000,000
   * Actual staked INIT after adding rewards = 1,000,000,000 (950,000,000 + 50,000,000)
4. User comes to stake 100,000,000 xINIT:

   * According to Cabal’s accounting: Exchange rate = 1,050,000,000 INIT / 1,000,000,000 sxINIT = 1.05
   * User should receive: 100,000,000 / 1.05 = 95,238,095 sxINIT
   * But the actual exchange rate should be: 1,000,000,000 INIT / 1,000,000,000 sxINIT = 1.0
   * User should actually receive: 100,000,000 / 1.0 = 100,000,000 sxINIT
5. The discrepancy:

   * User receives 95,238,095 sxINIT
   * These tokens are backed by only 90,702,948 INIT (95,238,095 \* 1,000,000,000 / 1,050,000,000)
   * This means the user has been short-changed by 4,761,905 INIT worth of backing

The issue becomes even more severe with multiple slashing events and/or larger stake amounts.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant and affects multiple areas:

1. **Violation of Core Protocol Invariants**: The fundamental invariant `1 xINIT ≈ 1 INIT` is broken. This undermines the entire economic model of the protocol as described in the documentation.
2. **Economic Dilution**: When new users stake xINIT and receive sxINIT based on incorrect exchange rates, they get fewer tokens than they should. This effectively transfers value from new users to existing sxINIT holders.
3. **Systemic Risk**: Each uncorrected slashing event compounds the problem. Over time, the divergence between tracked and actual amounts could become severe, potentially leading to:

   * Loss of user confidence in the protocol
   * Inability to properly value sxINIT tokens
   * Difficulty in integrating with other DeFi protocols due to unreliable pricing
4. **Unbonding Issues**: When users try to unstake their sxINIT tokens, they might not receive the expected amount of xINIT back, leading to unexpected losses.

This issue affects all users of the Cabal Protocol, with the severity increasing over time as more slashing events occur without correction.

### Recommended mitigation steps

**Sync with Reality**: Modify the `compound_xinit_pool_rewards` function to query the actual staked amounts after claiming rewards.
