# Unable To Withdraw Cake From WMC

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## wmasterchef.move Module Overview

In the `wmasterchef.move` module, cake rewards are collected from the Pancake Protocol into the resource account for every deposit and withdrawal. The cake rewards are harvested and reinvested in the protocol using the `harvest_reward` and `stake` functions by the whitelisted users. However, there is currently no way for the protocol to withdraw the cake rewards accumulated in the resource account.

## Remediation

It is recommended to add a permissioned function that transfers the cake rewards collected into the resource account to the treasury account.
