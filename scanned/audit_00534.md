# Change The Calculation Of Seed

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Code Review: Capy Labs Mix Function

During the mix in `capy_labs.move`, a new UID is created for the calculation and deleted once the calculation is done. This operation is unnecessary and may be replaced by invoking `tx_context::fresh_object_address`.

## Source Code

**File:** `sources/capy_labs.move`

```rust
public fun mix<T>(
    self: &mut CapyLabsApp,
    sf1: &mut SuiFren<T>,
    sf2: &mut SuiFren<T>,
    clock: &Clock,
    birth_location: String,
    paid: &mut Coin<SUI>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): SuiFren<T> {
    [...]
    let id = object::new(ctx);
    // Create seed based on multiple sources: clock, fresh uid and an inner hash.
    let seed = hash(&bcs::to_bytes(&vector[
        self.inner_hash,
        object::id_to_bytes(&object::uid_to_inner(&id)),
        bcs::to_bytes(clock)
    ]));
    object::delete(id);
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Change the method of seed calculation by utilizing `tx_context::fresh_object_address`.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `5462a42`.
