# Validate Tortuga Address

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Vulnerability in stake_router.move

In `stake_router.move`, several initialization and setter methods take in `tortuga: &signer` as a function parameter. The lack of checks against this parameter may result in vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet

```MOVE
public entry fun set_reward_commission(
    tortuga: &signer,
    value: u64
) acquires StakingStatus {
    let staking_status = borrow_global_mut<StakingStatus>(signer::address_of(tortuga));
    staking_status.reward_commission = value;
}
```

## Remediation

Include a check against the hard-coded `@tortuga` to ensure the addresses match.

```MOVE
assert!(
    signer::address_of(tortuga) == @tortuga,
    error::unauthenticated(EPERMISSION_DENIED)
);
```

## Patch

Resolved in commit **5ab8d72**.
