**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/farming.move`

**Description:** The two functions `new_reward<RewardCoin>` and `new_reward_fa` are used to register different tokens for reward payments. Under the hood, both of these functions call `new_reward_for_farming_internal` with the asset name. However, this can be problematic in the case of a name collision between an FA and a coin.

**Recommendation:** Consider making a small change to include the coin type as well. A very simple solution can be concatenating "FA_" for fungible assets and "C_" for coins to their names before passing them to `new_reward_for_farming_internal`.
