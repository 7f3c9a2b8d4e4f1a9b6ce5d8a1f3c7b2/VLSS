# Missing Check for Sequence Number

## Summary
The bug report states that there is an issue with the certify_event_blob function in a node. This function requires the input of an ending_checkpoint_sequence_num for the event blob being recorded. However, there is no validation for this input, which means that an incorrect value can be entered. This can cause a mismatch between the event blob being processed by the node and the on-chain tracking. To fix this, the report suggests tracking both the blob ID and the ending checkpoint sequence number when recording the event blob certification state. This issue has been addressed in a recent patch.

## Details
## Certification Event Blob Issue

When a node calls `certify_event_blob`, it is required to input the `ending_checkpoint_sequence_num` of the event blob being recorded. While there is validation for the blob ID, there is no validation for the ending checkpoint sequence number. As a result, the value provided by a quorum-reaching node gets recorded in the state. If an incorrect number is entered, it causes a mismatch between the event blob being processed by the node and the on-chain tracking.

## Remediation

Track both the blob ID and ending checkpoint sequence number when recording the event blob certification state.

## Patch

Fixed in `c873816`.
