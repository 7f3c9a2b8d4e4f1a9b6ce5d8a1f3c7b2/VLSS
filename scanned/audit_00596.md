# Denial Of Service In Withdraw And Cancel

## Summary
The report states that there is a bug in the protocol where withdrawing or cancelling requires transferring contract coins to the recipient. If the recipient is not registered to the contract coin and transfers are disabled, the amount becomes locked in the protocol. This can happen if the recipient's address is lost or input incorrectly. To fix this, the report suggests validating the recipient address using the coin::is_account_registered<X> check in create transfer and performing a coin initialization check on the X coin. This bug has been fixed in version 235786a by adding a coin register check for the recipient address in create and transfer.

## Details
## Protocol Withdrawal and Cancellation

In protocol, **withdraw** and **cancel** require transferring contract coins (X) to the recipient. If the recipient is not registered to the contract coin (X) and transfers are disabled, the amount becomes locked in the protocol. This may occur if the recipient’s address is lost or if the recipient’s address input is incorrect.

## Remediation

Validate the recipient address using the `coin::is_account_registered<X>` check in `create_transfer` to avoid errors in future transfers of withdraw. Additionally, perform a coin initialization check on the X coin.

## Patch

Fixed in **235786a** by adding a coin register check for the recipient address in `create_and_transfer`.
