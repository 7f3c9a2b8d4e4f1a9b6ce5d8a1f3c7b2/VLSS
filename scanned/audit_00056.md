# Judge can designate arbitrary winner who is neither maker nor taker

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Description:** When calling `Bet::resolve`, the nominated judge can designate an arbitrary winner to receive the winnings.

**Impact:** The judge can send the winnings to themselves or to any other non-related party who didn't participate in the bet, even though the bet is a contract between the `maker` and `taker`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** `Bet::resolve` should enforce that the winner is either the `maker` or the `taker`.

**WannaBet:** Fixed in commit [74654b5](https://github.com/gskril/wannabet-v2/commit/74654b59cc63c95c5ea8dd31f1e561bf7bd66285).

**Cyfrin:** Verified.
