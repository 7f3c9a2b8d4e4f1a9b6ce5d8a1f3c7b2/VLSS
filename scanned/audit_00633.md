# Missing Staker Reward Ensurance

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Reward System Documentation

Users who have staked coins to the pool earn rewards at a custom `reward_per_sec` rate.

```rust
let total_rewards = to_u128(pool.reward_per_sec) *
    to_u128(seconds_passed) * to_u128(pool.stake_scale);
```

The rewards are deposited in a permissionless manner in the pool.

## Function: deposit_reward_coins

```rust
/// Depositing reward coins to specific pool.
/// * `pool_addr` - address under which pool are stored.
/// * `coins` - R coins which are used in distribution as reward.
public fun deposit_reward_coins<S, R>(pool_addr: address, coins: Coin<R>)
    acquires StakePool {
    assert!(exists<StakePool<S, R>>(pool_addr), ERR_NO_POOL);
    [...]
    coin::merge(&mut pool.reward_coins, coins);
    event::emit_event<DepositRewardEvent>(
        &mut pool.deposit_events,
        DepositRewardEvent { amount },
    );
}
```

Because there are no enforcements at the smart contract level, an arbitrary number of rewards can be deposited. Rewards redemption operates on the principle of "First In, First Served." This aspect could become an issue when not enough rewards are deposited, potentially leading to a scenario where not all users are able to harvest their rewards.

## Remediation

Display a warning on the UI if the pool doesn’t have enough rewards to ensure that the pool owners are aware of the situation and can deposit more rewards.
