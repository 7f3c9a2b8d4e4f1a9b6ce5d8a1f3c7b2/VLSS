# Arbitrary Delete Of Orders

## Summary
The bug report describes a problem in the maven.move code where any user can call the execute_object_operation function with the wrong ASSET type and stop others from executing object operations. This is because the precheck fails and returns false, preventing the operation from being properly executed. The bug can be fixed by implementing the same checks as in the execute_coin_precheck function, which aborts the operation if the generic type does not match the asset key. The bug has been fixed in the code.

## Details
## Vulnerability in maven.move

In `maven.move`, any user can call `execute_object_operation` with the incorrect `ASSET` generic and pop the order from execution without properly executing it, as the precheck fails and returns false. This allows anyone to stop others from executing the object operations.

### Code Snippet

```rust
public entry fun execute_object_operation<ASSET: key + store>(
    global_pause: &Pause,
    maven: &mut Maven,
) {
    pause::ensure_not_paused(global_pause);
    let (order, op_sn) = order::pop_min_order(&mut maven.order_book);
    [...]
    while (i < op_count) {
        [...]
        let (success, error_code) = vault::execute_object_precheck<ASSET>(&maven.vault, &op);
        [...]
    };
    if (successes) {
        [...]
    };
}
```

## Remediation

Implement the same checks as in `execute_coin_precheck`, where if the generic `T` does not match the `asset_key`, the function aborts instead of continuing with the operation.

### Patch

Fixed in **cac0a8a**.
