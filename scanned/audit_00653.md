# Improper Calculation in Liquidation

## Summary
The bug report describes an issue with the profile.move function, specifically in the calculation of the amount of shares that need to be settled. The problem occurs in the liquidation function, where the settle_share_amount is not being calculated correctly. This is because the repay_amount is being directly returned as the settle share amount, instead of using the get_share_amount_from_borrow_amount function. This results in the overall value of a borrowed share being decreased, which can negatively impact the health of the protocol. The report includes a proof of concept scenario and suggests a possible solution to fix the issue. The bug has been resolved in the latest patch.

## Details
## Incorrect Share Settlement Calculation in `profile.move`

In `profile.move`, the amount of shares that need to be settled is calculated incorrectly. In the else case of the liquidation function, the `settle_share_amount` should be calculated from the `repay_amount` using the `get_share_amount_from_borrow_amount` function. Instead, the repay amount is directly returned as the settle share amount.

Since the value of shares increases with the accumulation of borrow interest, the actual `settle_share_amount` would be less than the `repay_amount`. Directly subtracting the repay amount from borrowed shares will decrease the overall value of a borrowed share and affect the health of the protocol.

## Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario:

1. A user borrows **X** amount from the protocol. This is recorded as **X** number of borrowed shares.
2. After some time, borrow interest accumulates and the total borrowed amount on the reserve increases, thus increasing the borrow share value.
3. Now, if the user’s account loses health and the liquidator liquidates **X** amount of the loan amount, only **X** amount of shares are subtracted from the user’s borrowed shares in spite of the increased borrowed share value.

## Remediation

A possible remediation is converting `repay_amount` to shares using the `get_share_amount_from_borrow_amount` function in the else case of the `liquidate_profile` function.
