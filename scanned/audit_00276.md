# Inconsistency In Debt Repaid And Collateral Seized

## Summary
The report discusses a bug in a liquidation process where the amount of debt repaid by the liquidator may be less than the original amount provided. This can result in the liquidatee losing funds and remaining vulnerable to further exploitation. The bug has been fixed in the latest update.

## Details
## Liquidation Process in Lending Pools

During liquidation, the liquidator specifies the repayment amount to be repaid on behalf of the liquidatee, and a fungible asset of that amount is provided as an argument to `repay`. 

`repay` utilizes `calculate_shares` to determine the exact number of shares to repay, rounding down in cases of non-perfect division. As a result, the liquidatee’s debt reduction may be less than the original fungible asset amount (`repaid_amount`). However, all subsequent calculations rely on the `repaid_amount` variable to determine the number of shares transferred from the liquidatee to the liquidator.

This discrepancy may decrease the liquidatee’s health factor, resulting in the liquidatee losing funds. Because the health factor decreases, the liquidatee remains liquidatable even after the liquidation. The caller may exploit this repeatedly, resulting in further financial loss to the liquidatee with each cycle.

## Remediation

Recalculate the `amount_repaid` based on the correct number of shares repaid.

Fixed in `1549b59`.
