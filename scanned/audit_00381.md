# Hardcoded Recipient In Init

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Code and Commentary

In `Recipient`, `addressconstant` represents a hardcoded address that will receive the `treasury_cap` for a token created during module initialization. This approach seems unusual, and we believe it may be safer to send the `treasury_cap` to the sender, who can later send it to the desired recipient.

```navi.move
const Recipient: address = @0x01; // **You need to specify an address to publish
// ... consts

fun init(witness: NAVI, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // ... code
    let (treasury_cap, metadata) = coin::create_currency<NAVI>(
        // ... args
    );
    // ... code
    transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, Recipient);
}
```

## Remediation

Transfer the newly created `treasury_cap` to the sender in the `init` function. The `treasury_cap` can later be sent to the desired recipient using the `public_transfer` function.

## Patch

Resolved in `990e9c4`.
