# Refactor Allowed Amount Implementation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Teleport::allowed_amount Design Overview

The current design of `teleport::allowed_amount` allows any user to call the function and receive the maximum token amount that the Administrator is allowed to mint. This function could be extended to allow users to provide the address for an arbitrary `TeleportAdmin` and retrieve the maximum number of tokens that the admin may mint.

In addition, there is an unnecessary signer parameter.

## Remediation

Replace the signer parameter with an address parameter and return the approved amount for the passed-in admin address.

### Code Example

```rust
sources/teleport.move

public entry fun allowed_amount(admin_addr: address): u64 acquires TeleportAdmin {
    assert!(is_teleport_admin(admin_addr), ENOT_TELEPORT_ADMIN);
    *&borrow_global<TeleportAdmin>(admin_addr).allowed_amount
}
```
