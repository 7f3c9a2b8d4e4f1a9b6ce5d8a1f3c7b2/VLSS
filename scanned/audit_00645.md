## Instant Unstake vs. Normal Unstake

In order to differentiate an instant unstake from a normal unstake, the unstake function receives an extra parameter called `is_instant : u8`. This value, if non-zero, will signal that the unstake must be done directly; otherwise, it will set a lockup period of 15 days and allow the user to withdraw the coins only after the period has passed.

## MeeStaking.move RUST

```rust
public entry fun unstake<StakeCoin, RewardCoin>(
    unstaker: &signer, 
    amount: u64, 
    is_instant: u8
) acquires PoolInfo, OwnerCapability, StakeInfo {
    [...]
    if (is_instant == 1) {
        // withdraw user's unlocked amount
        let instant_fee = amount * INSTANT_UNSTAKE_FEE / FEE_DIVIDER;
        let real_amount = amount - instant_fee;
```

The `is_instant` parameter is of type `u8`. Because it plays a flag role (signal if the unstake is done instantly or not), the parameter will only be found in two states: set or unset. This behavior is well-suited for the `bool` data type.

## Remediation

Change the type of the `is_instant` variable to `bool`.
