# Lack of Account Registration Check for Coin

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `fc23228`. Added `coin::register` calls in `liquidate` and `borrow_entry`.

**File(s) affected:**`isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** Different functions in the `isolated_lending::isolated_lending` module work with Move Coin. However, they miss proper registration for the coin before calling the `coin::deposit` function.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding proper coin registration for addresses.
