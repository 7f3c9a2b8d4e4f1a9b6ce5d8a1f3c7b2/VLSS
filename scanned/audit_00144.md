## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Security Assessment Report

## Severity
**Low Risk**

## Description
Current Vercel security settings are not fully optimized, leaving potential security gaps in deployment and access control. Basic security features available on the Pro plan are not fully utilized.

## Recommendation
Implement the following Vercel security configurations:

- Review and restrict team access permissions to only those who need access.
- Exclusively use passkey login with Yubikey for all team member and owner accounts.
- Use "sensitive" environment variables for Preview and Production environments.
- Enable Git Fork Protection to prevent unauthorized repository forks.
- Disable Vercel Toolbar in production environments. Pre-production environments can be optionally enabled if it is useful.

### Optional Monitoring Controls
Consider implementing these optional monitoring controls if budget and team bandwidth permit:

- Enable basic request logging for critical endpoints/routes.
- Configure simple error rate monitoring and alerts.
- Set up Slack notifications for deployment failures and critical errors.
- Document procedures for periodic log review.
