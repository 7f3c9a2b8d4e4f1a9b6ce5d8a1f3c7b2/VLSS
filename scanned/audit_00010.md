Marked as "Acknowledged" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> We can ensure create_bank can only be called once by the project administrator during contract deployment, and will not be called again thereafter.

**File(s) affected:**`bank.move`

**Description:** The `create_bank()` function allows the `ExchangeManagerCap` to create a shared `Bank` object for a `Coin T`. However, there is no check to ensure that a `Bank` for `T` already exists. If several `Bank`s for the same `Coin T` existed, this would lead to fund and protocol fragementation.

**Recommendation:** We recommend creating a Singleton Registry to ensure a `Bank` object exists only once for each `Coin T`.
