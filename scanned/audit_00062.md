# Functions Silently Fail

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Acknowledged by the client. The client provided the following explanation:

> Abort for unchanged state seems unnecessary. And in PTB if a moveCall abort the whole transaction fails. For example, we want to add checks to all CDP vaults and put all CDP vaults in transaction but one of the vault is already get added then we don't want the transaction to fail.

**File(s) affected:**`bucket_framework/sources/sheet.move`, `bucket_cdp/sources/vault.move`, `bucket_usd/sources/usdb.move`, `bucket_cdp/sources/acl.move`, `bucket_oracle/sources/collector.move`

**Description:** There are a number of `public` functions in the codebase that may be called with the intention of effecting some change in state, but that provide no feedback when there is no change. This can surprise users who expect some sort of feedback when a function does not do what it is supposed to do in the mind of the user.

The following is a list of instances:

1.   `sheet`
    1.   `add_creditor()`
    2.   `add_debtor()`
    3.   `ban()`
    4.   `unban()`

2.   `vault`
    1.   `add_request_check()`
    2.   `remove_request_check()`
    3.   `add_response_check()`
    4.   `remove_response_check()`

3.   `usdb`
    1.   `remove_module()`
    2.   `remove_version()`

4.   `acl`
    1.   `remove_role()`

5.   `collector`
    1.   `remove()`

**Recommendation:** Have each function either return a boolean indicating whether state was changed or throw an error if no state was changed.
