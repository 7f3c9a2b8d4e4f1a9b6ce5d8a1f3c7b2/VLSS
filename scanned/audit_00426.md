# Include Pending In Unstake

## Summary
This bug report discusses an issue with the native_pool::burn_ticket_non_entry function that is used to collect SUI coins for returns to the user. The problem is that the function does not take into account the coins held in NativePool::pending, which can lead to a vulnerability. The report provides a proof-of-concept code and suggests a fix by including NativePool::pending coins during the unstake process. The issue has been fixed in the latest version of the code.

## Details
## Native Pool Unstake and Vulnerabilities

The `native_pool::burn_ticket_non_entry` function employs `native_pool::unstake_amount_from_validators` to collect SUI for returns to the user. However, it does not consider the coins held in `NativePool::pending`.

## Code Snippet

```rust
let validators = validator_set::get_validators(&self.validator_set);
let unstaked_sui = unstake_amount_from_validators(self, wrapper, amount, fee, validators, ctx);
// assert should never be reached because the pool is self-sufficient
assert!(coin::value(&unstaked_sui) == amount - fee, E_NOTHING_TO_UNSTAKE);
```

`NativePool::pending` stores coins that will be staked once they accumulate to the minimum value of:

```rust
const ONE_SUI: u64 = 1_000_000_000;
```

There are two scenarios in which the augmentation of pending coins may occur:

1. When a user stakes an amount less than `ONE_SUI`.

    ```rust
    public fun stake_non_entry(..., coin: Coin<SUI>, ...): Coin<CERT> {
        // ...
        let coin_value = coin::value(&coin);
        assert!(coin_value >= self.min_stake, E_MIN_LIMIT);
        // ...
        coin::join(&mut self.pending, coin);
        // ...
        // stake pool
        stake_pool(self, wrapper, ctx);
    }
    ```

2. When there are remaining coins from the unstake process.

    ```rust
    if (total_removed_value > amount_to_unstake) {
        let stake_value = total_removed_value - amount_to_unstake;
        let balance_to_stake = balance::split(&mut total_removed_balance, stake_value);
        let coin_to_stake = coin::from_balance(balance_to_stake, ctx);
        coin::join(&mut self.pending, coin_to_stake);
        // restake is possible
        stake_pool(self, wrapper, ctx);
    };
    ```

## Volo Audit 04 | Vulnerabilities

The vulnerability arises when a user initiates an unstake action, transferring a portion of the coins to `NativePool::pending`, and another user attempts to unstake an amount exceeding the total actively staked value.

### Proof Of Concept

1. **Initial State**:
   - User A (normal) and User B (malicious).
   - Three `StakedSui` objects - [1 SUI (B), 100 SUI (A), 99.9 SUI (B)].
   
2. User A generates an `UnstakeTicket` for their entire stake (100 SUI).

3. User B initiates an unstake of 100.1 SUI before User A burns their ticket.

4. The protocol unstakes one SUI and 100 SUI stakes, remaining amount is 0.9 SUI which is less than one SUI.

5. `NativePool::pending = 0.9 SUI`, one `StakedSui` object is left [99.9 SUI].

6. User A is unable to burn their ticket.

Please find the proof-of-concept code in this section.

## Remediation

Include `NativePool::pending` coins during the unstake process.

### Patch Code

```rust
- let total_removed_balance = balance::zero<SUI>();
- let total_removed_value = 0;
+ let total_removed_value = coin::value(&self.pending);
+ let total_removed_balance = coin::into_balance(coin::split(&mut self.pending, total_removed_value, ctx));
let collectable_reward = 0;
```

**Fixed in 8099e49.**
