# Prevent Irreparable Governance State

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## SetGovernanceDataSource

The `SetGovernanceDataSource` action is used to change the cross-chain address of the governance message emitter authority. If a `SetGovernanceDataSource` VAA was executed with an incorrect DataSource, it would leave the contract in a state where no new governance messages would be accepted (assuming no one could emit messages as the incorrect new data source).

It’s improbable that this would happen since it requires an error from a trusted entity. However, we recommend safeguarding the implementation and ensuring that the new DataSource is valid and operational before switching to it. 

## Remediation

One possible way to fix the issue would be to introduce a time period where governance messages would be accepted from an old DataSource. This would allow for contract repair in case of the error described above.

We recommend introducing a two-step procedure for updating `GovernanceDataSource`. The first step would stage a new `GovernanceDataSource` but not activate it directly. This new source would be activated once the Aptos contract receives at least one wormhole message from it, implying that the cross-chain address is operational.
