# Lack Of Functionalities In Storage

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## ReserveData Fields in storage.move

In `storage.move`, there are two important fields in `ReserveData`: 

- `is_isolated`
- `treasury_balance`

These variables hold crucial information about the state of the system. However, there are no getter functions provided to access them.

## Source Code

```rust
struct ReserveData {
    [...]
    // isolated
    is_isolated: bool,
    [...]
    // fee balance
    treasury_balance: u256,
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Implement getter functions to retrieve `is_isolated` and `treasury_balance` fields from `ReserveData`.
