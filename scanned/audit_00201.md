## Enhancements to Reward Management

1. For improved functionality and control, add functions to remove an address from the `reward_managers` list in `config`, and to update the `is_paused` state of the pool.

2. Include the entry keyword in `gateway::collect_reward` to allow the function to be called externally, enabling users to easily retrieve their rewards from their liquidity positions in the pool.

> _sources/gateway.move move_
>
> /// Allows user to collect the rewards accrued on their position
> public fun collect_reward<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB, RewardCoinType>(
> clock: &Clock,
> protocol_config: &GlobalConfig,
> pool: &mut Pool<CoinTypeA, CoinTypeB>,
> position: &mut Position,
> ctx: &mut TxContext
> ){
> [...]
> }

## Remediation
Implement the above-mentioned suggestions.

## Patch
Resolved in `f9025e9`.
