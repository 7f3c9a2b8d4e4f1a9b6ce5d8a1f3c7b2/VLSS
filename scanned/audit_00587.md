# Insufficient sanity checks for treasury creation

## Summary
The bug report is about a medium severity issue that has been resolved. In a specific function called `create_treasury`, there are no checks in place to ensure that certain variables have valid values. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and issues. The recommendation is to add checks to make sure that these variables have the correct values.

## Details
**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In contract token_vesting.move, in function `create_treasury` there are no sanity checks for the `total_lock_in_days`, `vesting_period_in_days` and `initial_lock_in_days` variables. It would be ideal to add checks to prevent these values from being zero or being invalid combinations. Also, the `vesting_period_in_days` and `initial_lock_in_days` parameters are not checked to make sure they are not greater than the variable `total_lock_in_days` which could lead to unexpected behavior if the vesting period 	is longer than the total lock period. Even if these values are set in a function that’s protected by admin rights, there is a chance that a mistake is made and not noticed before it leads to a possible issue.

**Recommendation**: 

Add sanity checks to make sure that these parameters are set to the correct values.
