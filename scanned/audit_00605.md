# Critical Checks In Weighted Math

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Math Module Overview

In the math module, `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal` are responsible for calculating the amounts to be given in and out.

It is critical to assert that `weight_ratio > 0` in both `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal` to avoid situations where:

- `amountIn = balanceIn` is irrespective of `amountOut`
- `amountOut = 0` is irrespective of `amountIn`

## Remediation

Enforce the `weight_ratio > 0` constraint in `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal`.

## Patch

Fixed in #109.
