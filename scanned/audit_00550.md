# Decrease Remaining Mixes Of SuiFrens

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Users May Arbitrarily Call `decrease_remaining_mixes_by_one`

Users may supply their SuiFrens and reduce the remaining mix in the object without minting a new SuiFrens. This function also does not check if the `remaining_mix` is set to `None()`, aborting the application.

## Code Snippet

```rust
sources/genesis.move

public fun decrease_remaining_mixes_by_one<T>(self: &mut SuiFren<T>) {
    let rm = option::borrow(&self.remaining_mixes);
    assert!(*rm >= 1, 0);
    option::swap(&mut self.remaining_mixes, *rm - 1);
}
```

## Remediation

1. Ensure that the function may be called only during the mixing process.
2. Add a check to ensure that the `remaining_mix` is not set to `None()`.

## Patch

Mysten acknowledged this issue and removed the `remaining_mixes` field from `SuiFren` and consequently `decrease_remaining_mixes_by_one`.
