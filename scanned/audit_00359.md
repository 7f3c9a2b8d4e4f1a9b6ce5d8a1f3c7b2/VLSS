# Payload Size Limitation

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Token Transfer Payload Issue

Users may create a token transfer payload with less than 64 bytes, resulting in an invalid target address in the Move message. Consequently, when attempting to claim the tokens on Ethereum, the invalid target address would prevent the successful execution of the transaction, thereby rendering the tokens unclaimable on the Ethereum chain.

## Remediation

Implement proper validation checks on the payload size and content within the Move message to ensure it satisfies the required criteria.

## Patch

Fixed in PR #17139.
