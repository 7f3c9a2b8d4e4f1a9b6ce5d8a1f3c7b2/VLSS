## Security Assessment Report

## Severity: Low Risk

### Description
During our assessment, we identified the following implemented controls:
- **CAPTCHA based user verification.**
- **2 external moderators + core team with 'core' role.**
- **Using several bots including MEE6, AFK Bot, and Wick.**
- **Large member base (33,823 members).**
- **Any member can create unlimited-duration invite links.**

Our analysis revealed several potential security exposures:
- **Limited protection against coordinated malicious activity.**
- **No documented security procedures or incident response.**
- **Unclear bot permission boundaries and usage.**

### Recommendations

#### 2. Bot Security:
- Audit each bot's permissions and remove unnecessary access.
- Document active bots' purposes and configurations.
- Remove unused integrations.
- Enable Discord's AutoMod for baseline protection:

  - Block suspicious links.
  - Set message rate limits.

#### 3. Moderation Controls:
- Create clear moderator guidelines including:
  - Allowed/disallowed actions.
