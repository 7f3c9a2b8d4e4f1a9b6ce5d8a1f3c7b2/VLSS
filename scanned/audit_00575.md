# Missing Signer Count Check In Permission

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Permission Move Issue

In `permission.move`, `has_enough_weight` does not ensure that the value of `signer_count` is greater than zero.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun has_enough_weight(role_book: &RoleBook, permission: &Permission, weight: u64): bool {
    let signers_count = role::get_signer_amount_by_role(role_book, permission.approver);
    let threshold = math::min(permission.threshold, signers_count);
    weight >= threshold
}
```

## Remediation

Insert an assert statement to ensure that `signers_count` is always greater than zero.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `4204eb4`.
