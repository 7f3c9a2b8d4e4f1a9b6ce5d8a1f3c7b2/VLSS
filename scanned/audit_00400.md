## Signature Mechanism Vulnerability

In several functions, a signature is used to authorize and validate an action that permits users to execute specific operations only if authorized by the off-chain authority. However, in the current implementation of the signature mechanism, the same signed operation may be submitted and processed multiple times. Thus, if a malicious actor captures a valid signed transaction, they may utilize that to successfully execute that particular action repeatedly. This executes the same operation multiple times without any further demand for authentication.

## Remediation

Include a nonce in the signed transaction to enable the system to check if the nonce is valid and has not been utilized before processing the transaction.

## Patch

Fixed in f19c8e1.
