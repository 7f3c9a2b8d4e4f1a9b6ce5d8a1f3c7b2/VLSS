## Details
## USDA Timed Limit Reset

USDA `usda_timed_limit` resets discretely after a period of `usda_timed_duration` seconds.

## Code Snippet

```rust
argo_engine/sources/engine_v1.move RUST
fun update_timed_period(laboratory: &mut Laboratory) {
    let now = timestamp::now_seconds();
    let time_elapsed = now - laboratory.usda_timed_last_reset;
    if (time_elapsed > laboratory.usda_timed_duration) {
        laboratory.usda_timed_last_reset = now;
        laboratory.usda_timed_usage = 0;
    };
}
```

## Remediation

This isn’t particularly impactful and can likely be mitigated by adjusting the limits such that double the rate limit is still acceptable.

## Patch

Argo acknowledges the rate limit behavior and will choose parameters accordingly.
