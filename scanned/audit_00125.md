**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/lending.move`, `isolated_lending/sources/isolated_lending.move`

**Description:** There are three functions that allow the `manager` role to decrease the liquidation threshold for specific markets. This may cause positions in the affected markets to be immediately liquidatable:

1.   `set_efficiency_mode_liquidation_threshold_bps` may decrease the liquidation threshold for all markets in a specific e-mode.
2.   `set_market_liquidation_threshold_bps` may decrease the liquidation threshold for a specified market.
3.   `market_quit_efficiency_mode` decreases the liquidation threshold of a market by changing its e-mode to the standard parameters. 

In other lending protocols like Aave v3, the parameters can only be changed through on-chain governance. The governance process enforces a delay on the parameter changes, such that users can make necessary changes to their positions to prevent a strong impact.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding a delay to the parameter changes. This can be done through functions in the `lending_manager::manager` module that announce parameter changes and enforce a delay before the `manager` can apply the changes in the `lending::lending` and `isolated_lending::isolated_lending` modules.
