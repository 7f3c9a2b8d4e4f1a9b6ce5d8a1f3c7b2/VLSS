# Utilization of Empty Investor ID

## Investor Registration in Registry Service

In `registry_service::register_investor`, an empty string as an ID may be treated differently from other valid IDs. An empty string ID has a special meaning in the contract and will break many parts of the logic if an investor registers with such an ID. 

An example is that `is_wallet` will return true for any wallet, as if the investor does not exist, `get_investor` will return `""`. This will create confusion in the contract’s logic, where functions that check for investor existence may incorrectly identify an empty ID as a valid investor.

```rust
/// Registers a new investor with the given ID and collision hash. Only callable by issuer or
/// transfer agent or above.
public entry fun register_investor(
    authorizer: &signer, 
    id: String, 
    collision_hash: String
) acquires InvestorInfo {
    trust_service::assert_only_issuer_or_transfer_agent_or_above(authorizer);
    assert!(!is_investor(id), EINVESTOR_ALREADY_EXISTS);
    
    let investor = Investor {
        id,
        collision_hash,
        creator: signer::address_of(authorizer),
        last_updated_by: signer::address_of(authorizer),
        country: string::utf8(b""), 
        wallet_count: 0, 
        wallets: vector::empty()
    };
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Add an assertion to ensure that the ID is not an empty string (`id != ""`).

**Patch**

Resolved in commit `06538b8`.
