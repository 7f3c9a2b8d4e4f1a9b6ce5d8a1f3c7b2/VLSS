# `TokenLocker::getTotalWeightAt` should loop until input `week` not `systemWeek`

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Description:** `TokenLocker::getTotalWeightAt` should loop until input `week` not `systemWeek`:
```diff
- while (updatedWeek < systemWeek) {
+ while (updatedWeek < week) {
```

The current implementation returns the wrong output when `week < systemWeek` and the previous weekly writes have not occurred which triggers processing of the final `while` loop, since it counts all the way up to `systemWeek` instead of stopping once reaching the input `week`.

A similar function `getAccountWeightAt` does this final loop correctly counting only up to the input `week`. Other similar functions `IncentiveVoting::getReceiverWeightAt` and `getTotalWeightAt` also implement this correctly counting only up to the input `week`.

**Cyfrin:** Verified.
