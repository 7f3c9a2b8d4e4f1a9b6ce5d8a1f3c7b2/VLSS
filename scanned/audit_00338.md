# WEAK PASSWORD POLICY

## Summary
The bug report states that there is a problem with the password policy when setting up a password for a user. This means that users are able to choose weak passwords that can easily be guessed by attackers. The report includes a list of values that are considered too weak, such as numbers in sequential order or simple letter combinations. This vulnerability makes it easy for attackers to gain access to user accounts through brute-force attacks. The impact of this issue is rated as 3 out of 5 and the likelihood of it happening is 4 out of 5. The recommendation from the team is to accept the risk of this issue.

## Details
##### Description

There was no password policy enforced when user was setting up the password.
Weak passwords are considered to be those that are short, employ common words, system/software defaults, or any terms that could be quickly guessed by executing a brute force attack using a subset of all possible passwords, such as dictionary words, proper nouns, username-based words, or common variations on these themes and even company-related.

It was possible to configure as user's password the following values:

* `0123456789`
* `000000`
* `aaaaaa`
* `abcdef`

These values are considered as too weak passwords.

Due to lack of implementation of robust password policy (see the following vulnerabilities), it may be easy for an attacker to brute-force user accounts and compromise them.

##### Score

Impact: 3  
Likelihood: 4

##### Recommendation

**RISK ACCEPTED**: The `Pontem Network team` accepted the risk of the issue.
