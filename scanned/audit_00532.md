## Code Review: `lor` Function in `capy_labs.move`

In `capy_labs.move`, the `lor` function takes in two arguments and returns a boolean value based on whether the first argument is less than the second argument. However, this functionality may be achieved with a simple comparison operator instead of a dedicated function.

## Current Implementation
```rust
fun lor(rng: u8, cmp: u8): bool {
    (rng < cmp)
}
```

## Remediation
Remove the function and replace the invocation with a comparison.

## Patch
Fixed in commit `5462a42`.
