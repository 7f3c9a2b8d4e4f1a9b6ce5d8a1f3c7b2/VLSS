> Same with [[DIP-9](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/dipcoin-perpetual/ea7e8c75-4423-49da-a381-1d39997cfff7/index.html#findings-qs9)]

**File(s) affected:**`perpetual.move`

**Description:** The function `perpetual::transfer_insurance_fund_from_security_to_active()` is restricted by amount limits and time intervals to protect the security pool. However, the same `ExchangeManagerCap` required to call this function can also be used to modify these limits via `perpetual::set_insurance_fund_transfer_amount_limit()` and `perpetual::set_insurance_fund_transfer_interval()`. This means a compromised or malicious manager can bypass the safety controls by first relaxing the limits and then draining the pool.

**Recommendation:** Consider separating the roles for fund transfers and parameter configuration.
