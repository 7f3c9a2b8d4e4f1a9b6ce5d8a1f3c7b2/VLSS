## Issue Overview

The issue is related to the fact that both `stop_ride` and `resume_ride` functions expect `Driver` and `Rider` objects to be passed as arguments at the same time. It should be impossible for the user to own both `Driver` and `Rider` objects.

## Code Snippet

```rust
public fun stop_ride(_rider: &Rider, driver: &Driver, ride: &mut Ride) {
    assert!(driver.driver_address == *option::borrow<address>(&ride.driver), EDriverDoesNotMatchRide);
    assert!(ride.state == RideStatusRideStarted, ERideHaventStartedYet);
    assert!(vector::length(&ride.stops) > 0, ENoStopsForThatRide);
    [...]
}

public fun resume_ride(_rider: &Rider, driver: &Driver, ride: &mut Ride, waiting_time: u64) {
    assert!(driver.driver_address == *option::borrow<address>(&ride.driver), EDriverDoesNotMatchRide);
    assert!(ride.state == RideStatusRideStopped, ERideHaventStoppedYet);
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Remove the `Rider` parameter.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `65fc7b0`.
