# Misleading Documentation Regarding Liquidations in Delisted Markets

## Summary
No summary provided.

**Update**
Marked as "Fixed" by the client. Addressed in: `85359e49d94a7d10ee986e7c97b7323199aab339`.

**File(s) affected:**`perpetual.move`

**Description:** The documentation for `perpetual::delist_perpetual()` states that "Liquidations continue (prevents bankruptcy)" after a market is delisted. However, the code explicitly blocks liquidations via `assert!(!perpetual::delisted(perp))` in `exchange::liquidate()`. The developers have confirmed that liquidations are indeed intended to stop, and the documentation is incorrect.

**Recommendation:** Update the documentation for `perpetual::delist_perpetual()` to remove the documentation saying that liquidations continue even after market delisting.
