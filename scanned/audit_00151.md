# Missing Security Vulnerability Reporting Process

## Summary
This bug report highlights a medium risk issue in a project where there is no clear process for security researchers to report vulnerabilities. This also means that there is no bug bounty program in place to incentivize responsible disclosure. This lack of a published security contact information or bug bounty program makes it difficult for researchers to report vulnerabilities, potentially leaving the project vulnerable to hacks. The report recommends establishing a public security reporting process and bug bounty program, including creating a security.txt file with contact details, adding security contact information to the website and documentation, defining scope and rewards for the bug bounty program, using a platform to manage submissions, and setting SLAs for initial response to reports.

## Details
## Security Vulnerability Report

## Severity: Medium Risk

### Description
The project lacks a clear process for security researchers to report vulnerabilities and has no defined bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure. Not having published security contact information or a bug bounty program makes it difficult for security researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Sometimes, a quick way to contact the development team can make a big difference in defending against hacks. The lack of a public bounty program may incentivize black hats to conduct a hack instead of reporting the issue.

### Recommendation
Establish a public security reporting process and bug bounty program:
- Create `security.txt` at `/.well-known/security.txt` with contact details.
- Add security contact information to the website and documentation.
- Publish scope and rewards for the bug bounty program.
- Consider using the Immunefi platform to manage the bounty program and submissions.
- Include an encrypted contact method (e.g., PGP key).
- Define SLAs for initial response to reports.
