## Event Emission Issues in Oracle and Treasury

**Issue Summary**

`IncreaseLengthEvent` in `oracle::increase_oracle_length` is emitted even if the new length equals the old length. Similarly, `WithdrawEvent` in `treasury::withdraw` is emitted when a zero amount is withdrawn. These cases of incorrect event emission may result in discrepancies and unintended behavior affecting any functionality relying on these events; additionally, they hamper the debugging process.

## Code Snippet

### Increase Oracle Length

```move
/// Add new sample slots to oracle.
public fun increase_oracle_length<X, Y, BinStep>(samples_to_add: u64) acquires Oracle {
    let oracle = borrow_global_mut<Oracle<X, Y, BinStep>>(@liquidswap_v1_resource_account);
    let current_length = oracle.length;
    let new_length = current_length + samples_to_add;
    [...]
    event::emit_event(&mut oracle.increase_length_event_handler, IncreaseLengthEvent {
        new_length: current_length,
    });
}
```

### Withdraw from Pair Treasury

```move
/// Withdraw from pair treasury.
public fun withdraw<X, Y, BinStep>(
    dao: &signer,
    amount_x: u64,
    amount_y: u64
): (Coin<X>, Coin<Y>) acquires Treasury {
    let treasury = borrow_global_mut<Treasury<X, Y, BinStep>>(@liquidswap_v1_resource_account);
    assert!(signer::address_of(dao) == config::get_dao_address(), ERR_NO_PERMISSION);
    let coins_x = coin::extract(&mut treasury.coins_x, amount_x);
    let coins_y = coin::extract(&mut treasury.coins_y, amount_y);
    [...]
    event::emit_event(&mut treasury.withdraw_event_handler, WithdrawEvent {
        amount_x, amount_y,
    });
}
```

## Remediation

Ensure the `IncreaseLengthEvent` is only emitted when there is a change in the length of the oracle, and `WithdrawEvent` does not emit when the amount to be withdrawn is equal to zero.
