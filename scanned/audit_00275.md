# Flash Loan Accessibility Restriction

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Lending Pool Functions

In `lending_pool`, `start_flashloan`, and `end_flashloan` are marked as `public(friend)`, implying they may only be called by other modules or addresses that are designated as friends of the module, not by external users directly. This restriction renders the flash loan functionality unusable to the general public, as they will be restricted from triggering these functions.

## Remediation

Mark `start_flashloan` and `end_flashloan` as `public`.

## Patch

Fixed in commit `4836577`.
