# Signature Handling Inconsistency

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Solidity Bridge Update

In the Solidity bridge, `verifySignatures` skips duplicate signatures and unregistered signers utilizing the `continue` statement. This method deviates from the stricter validation approach adopted by the Move bridge code, which aborts on such conditions.

> _evm/contracts/BridgeCommittee.sol

```solidity
function verifySignatures(bytes[] memory signatures, BridgeMessage.Message memory message) 
public 
view 
override 
{
    [...]
    // skip if signer is block listed or has no stake
    if (blocklist[signer] || committeeStake[signer] == 0) continue;
    [...]
    else {
        // skip if duplicate signature
        continue;
    }
    [...]
}
```

## Remediation

Adopts stricter validation within `verifySignatures`, following the approach used in the Move bridge code.

## Patch

Fixed in PR #16934.
