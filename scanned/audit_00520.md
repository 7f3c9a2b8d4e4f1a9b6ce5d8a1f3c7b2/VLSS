## Managing Hero NFT Attributes in `arcade_champion`

In `arcade_champion`, the `mint_hero` function along with other update functions are utilized to manage the attributes of the Hero NFT, such as tier, star_rating, and level. Applying validation constraints on these input arguments will ensure their adherence to their specific criteria.

```rust
hero_v0.1/sources/arcade_champion.move

public fun mint_hero(
    _: &mut AdminCap, 
    name: String, 
    tier: String,
    star_rating: u8, 
    level: u8, 
    image_url: String,
    edition: String, 
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): Hero {
    let hero_nft = Hero {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        name,
        tier,
        star_rating,
        level,
        image_url,
        edition,
        exported: false,
    };
    // returned Hero
    hero_nft
}
```

## Validation Constraints

For instance:
1. **star_rating:** Perform a range check within the limits of 0-5 or 0-10.
2. **level:** Impose a minimum level (1) and a maximum level (N) check.
3. **tier:** Validate the string against a predefined set of possible values.

Although these functions are currently only called by the custodial address, it is still beneficial to prevent accidental improper updates that could lead to unexpected behavior in applications that depend on these values. This proactive approach helps maintain the consistency and integrity of the system.

Additionally, a constraints dynamic may be created by sharing a singleton structure that contains a configuration with the specified constraints. The admin would then have the authority to update this configuration as needed.

## Remediation

Enforce constraints on the specified values of the Hero NFT.
