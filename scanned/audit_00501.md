# Critical Checks In Weighted Math

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Internal Calculation Functions

In the math module, `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal` are responsible for calculating the amounts to be given in and out. 

It is critical to assert that `weight_ratio > 0` in `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal` to avoid the cases where `amountIn = balanceIn` is irrespective of `amountOut` and `amountOut = 0` is irrespective of `amountIn`.

## Remediation

Enforce the `weight_ratio > 0` constraint in `calc_in_given_out_internal` and `calc_out_given_in_internal`.

## Patch

Fixed in #109.
