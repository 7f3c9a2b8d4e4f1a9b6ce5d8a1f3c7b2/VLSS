# Index Mismatch

## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
## Vulnerability Overview

The vulnerability concerns the assumption in `request_ride` that the `car_type` parameter corresponds directly to an index in the `car_types_info` table. This assumption may result in inaccuracies if the `car_type` value doesn’t match the actual index in the table.

`request_ride` utilizes a loop to iterate over car types, assuming that `car_type` is an index in the `car_types_info` table. Thus, if, for any reason, the `car_type` value provided does not match the actual index in the table, it may select the incorrect car type information, resulting in several issues including fare calculation and car type selection.

## Remediation

Replace the current table-based approach with a vector for storing car type information and update the `car_type` parameter to reflect the index of the car type information within the vector.
