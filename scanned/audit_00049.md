# [L-03] Delegate Remains Powerful After Admin Renounces

## Description

The OApp role model separates the “admin” from the “delegate”. Authorization for most endpoint‑level actions is enforced by `assert_authorized`, which compares the caller to `get_delegate()` and does not involve the admin field. Functions such as `set_config`, `set_send_library()`, `set_receive_library()`, `register_receive_pathway()`, `clear()`, `skip()`, `burn()`, and `nilify()` all gate on `assert_authorized`, so a configured delegate retains the ability to change messaging libraries, manipulate receive pathways, and administratively act on queued messages.

Conversely, admin‑only operations use `assert_admin` and affect state kept within the OApp itself, for example, `set_peer()`, `remove_peer()`, `set_enforced_options()`, and `transfer_admin()`. The `renounce_admin()` path only executes `set_admin(@0x0)` and emits `AdminTransferred`, leaving `get_delegate()` unchanged.

As a result, after an admin renounces, the system remains controllable by the delegate with respect to all actions guarded by `assert_authorized`. This means renouncing admin does not remove a significant class of control over endpoint interactions and operational message handling - any expectations that renouncing produces a fully permissionless state would be incorrect unless the delegate is first cleared by `set_delegate(@0x0)`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [sources/shared_oapp/oapp_core.move#L239-L244](https://github.com/Chainwith/RWD_BRIDGE/blob/c68e1d39d98b2e819021384771a0bf4722ec5947/sources/shared_oapp/oapp_core.move#L239-L244)

```move
/// Permanently renounce OApp admin rights. Once this is called, the admin cannot be reinstated
public entry fun renounce_admin(account: &signer) {
    let admin = address_of(move account);
    assert_admin(admin);
    oapp_store::set_admin(@0x0);
    emit(AdminTransferred { admin: @0x0 });
}
```

## Impact

After the admin renounces, the delegate (if set) still has authority over endpoint configurations and actions. In a decentralized scenario, this can mislead users, as significant control persists.

## Recommendation

We recommend documenting clearly that renouncing does not remove delegate powers.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.
