# Minimum Stake Bypass

## Summary
The Tortuga protocol has a bug in its delegation_service module, which manages pools and computes rewards for validators and delegators. While most users delegate through Tortuga, validators can also receive direct delegations through the delegation_service API. However, the function that ensures the minimum delegation amount is met does not apply to withdrawals, allowing users to bypass this limit by delegating a large amount and then immediately withdrawing it. To fix this, a restriction will be imposed on direct delegations to maintain a minimum amount or withdraw all funds. This bug has been fixed in the latest patch.

## Details
## Tortuga Protocol and Delegation Service

The Tortuga protocol operates on top of the `delegation_service` module, which controls the pools and computes rewards for validators and delegators. While most users will delegate indirectly through Tortuga (`stake_router`), validators may also receive direct delegations through the `delegation_service` API. 

## Direct Delegation

Users who wish to delegate directly may invoke `delegation_service::delegate` and provide an amount. Internally, this function ensures that the amount provided meets a minimum delegation amount, which is configurable by the pool owner:

```move
fun certify_delegation(
    managed_pool_address: address,
    delegator_address: address,
    amount: u64
) { 
    ...
    assert!(
        amount >= managed_stake_pool.min_delegation_amount,
        error::invalid_argument(EDELEGATION_AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL)
    );
    ...
}
```

While this check ensures that the instantaneous delegation amount is above the required minimum, withdrawals do not impose this limit. Therefore, a user may delegate some amount of stake higher than `min_delegation_amount`, then immediately withdraw a large portion to effectively bypass this limit.

## Remediation

Impose a restriction on direct delegations such that delegators maintain a minimum delegation amount at all times or withdraw all their funds.

## Patch

Fixed in `af0d61f`.
