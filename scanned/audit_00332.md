# Missing Validations

## Issues and Remediation

1. In Master, the sync functions (`sync_title`, `sync_image_url`, and `sync_media_url`) blindly update the attributes of a Master object based on the corresponding attributes of a Metadata object without verifying if the Metadata object is the one intended to be associated with the Master object.

2. `core::bump_registry_version` lacks a check to ensure that the new version is greater than the current one. Maintaining version consistency ensures compatibility and proper functioning in a system with multiple modules and components. If one updates the version to a value lower than the current registry version, it will result in inconsistencies and potential system behavior errors.

    > _move/sources/core.move rust_

    /// Admin can update the registry's version.
    public fun bump_registry_version(registry: &mut Registry, _: &AdminCap) {
        registry.version = VERSION;
    }

3. `master::set_revenue_total` does not verify that the sum of `revenue_available`, `revenue_paid`, and `revenue_pending` equals `revenue_total`.

## Remediation

1. Ensure the sync functions verify that the Metadata object being passed is indeed associated with the Master object, comparing `master.id` with `metadata.master_id`.

2. Add a check to ensure that the new VERSION is greater than the current one in `core::bump_registry_version`.

3. Ensure that the sum of available, paid, and pending revenue equals the total revenue to maintain data integrity.

## Patch

1. Fixed in `f6180a6`.

2. Fixed in `8d4a3c2`.
