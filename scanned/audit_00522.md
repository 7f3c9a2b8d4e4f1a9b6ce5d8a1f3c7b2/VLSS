## Importance of Consistent Documentation and Code Style

Consistent documentation and code style help prevent developer errors. Improvements may occur by:

1. Explicitly indicating time units in variables that store time durations, such as in `DEFAULT_DURATION`.
2. Correcting the incorrect comment on `name_record::has_expired`.

## Remediation

- Clarify time units in variables storing time durations and correct any inaccurate comments.
