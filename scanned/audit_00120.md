## Summary
No summary provided.

## Details
**Update**
Addressed in: `9398142`. Fixed as per recommendation.

**File(s) affected:**`lending_core/sources/farming.move`

**Description:** A comment above the `new_pool` function indicates that another function named `new_reward_for_pool` should exist to tie a pool with a specific reward. However, this function is nowhere to be found in the rest of the code.

**Recommendation:** Make sure that this function is no longer needed, and if so, adjust the comment accordingly.
