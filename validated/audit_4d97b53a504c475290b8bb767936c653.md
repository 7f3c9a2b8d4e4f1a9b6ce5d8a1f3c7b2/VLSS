## Title
Redemption Return Mismatch Causes Withdrawal and Fee Claim Failures Due to Unaccounted Fees and Rounding

## Summary
The `unstake_n_sui()` function in the Suilend staker module fails to account for unstake fees (up to 5%) and rounding errors (up to 10 MIST) that are deducted by the liquid staking protocol during LST redemption. This causes legitimate withdrawals and fee claims to abort when they attempt to split more SUI than is actually available in the balance.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the interaction between `unstake_n_sui()` and its callers (`withdraw()` and `claim_fees()`). [1](#0-0) 

In `unstake_n_sui()`, the function calculates the LST amount to redeem using ceiling division to ensure sufficient LST is burned for the target `sui_amount_out`: [2](#0-1) 

However, when it calls `liquid_staking::redeem()` (which internally executes the `unstake()` function), the actual SUI returned is reduced by fees. The liquid staking protocol's `unstake()` function deducts fees from the redeemed SUI: [3](#0-2) 

Specifically, the fee deduction occurs at: [4](#0-3) 

The unstake fee can be up to 5% (500 bps) as defined by the fee caps: [5](#0-4) 

Additionally, the `split_n_sui()` function can return up to 10 MIST less than requested due to acceptable rounding tolerance: [6](#0-5) 

Where `ACCEPTABLE_MIST_ERROR` is defined as: [7](#0-6) 

The critical failure occurs in the `withdraw()` function: when `sui_balance` is insufficient (line 88), it calls `unstake_n_sui(unstake_amount)` expecting to receive at least `unstake_amount` in SUI. However, if fees are deducted, `sui_balance` will be short of the required amount, causing the subsequent `split(withdraw_amount)` at line 93 to abort with insufficient balance.

The same issue affects `claim_fees()`: [8](#0-7) 

## Impact Explanation

**Direct Operational Impact (DoS):**
- Legitimate user withdrawals fail when unstake fees are configured or rounding errors occur
- Fee collection by the protocol fails, preventing administrators from claiming protocol revenue
- With even a 1% unstake fee, any withdrawal requiring unstaking will systematically fail

**Quantified Damage:**
If `unstake_fee_bps = 100` (1%), attempting to withdraw 1000 SUI when `sui_balance` has 100 SUI:
- Needs to unstake: 900 SUI
- After 1% fee: receives ~891 SUI
- Total balance: 100 + 891 = 991 SUI
- Attempts to split 1000 SUI → **TRANSACTION ABORTS**

With maximum 5% fee, the shortfall is even more severe (900 SUI needed, ~855 SUI received).

**Who is Affected:**
- All users attempting withdrawals when the staker needs to unstake LST
- Protocol administrators unable to claim accumulated fees
- The Suilend integration becomes effectively unusable when fees are enabled

## Likelihood Explanation

**Reachable Entry Point:**
The `withdraw()` function is `public(package)` and called during normal Suilend reserve operations, making this reachable through standard protocol usage without requiring any special permissions.

**Feasible Preconditions:**
- Unstake fees are enabled (configurable up to 5%)
- User requests a withdrawal larger than current `sui_balance`
- This is a common scenario in normal operation

**Execution Practicality:**
The issue is deterministic and occurs automatically whenever:
1. Unstake fees are non-zero (any value from 0.01% to 5%)
2. Withdrawal requires unstaking LST to meet the amount
3. No special attacker actions needed - legitimate users are affected

**Economic Rationality:**
This is not an attack but a logic error that manifests during normal operations. The likelihood is **HIGH** because it occurs naturally whenever fees are configured.

## Recommendation

Modify `unstake_n_sui()` to account for fees and rounding errors when calculating the required SUI. The function should request additional SUI to cover the maximum possible fees:

```move
fun unstake_n_sui<P: drop>(
    staker: &mut Staker<P>,
    system_state: &mut SuiSystemState,
    sui_amount_out: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    if (sui_amount_out == 0) {
        return
    };

    // Account for maximum 5% unstake fee + 10 MIST rounding error
    let adjusted_amount = sui_amount_out * 10500 / 10000 + 10; // Add 5% + 10 MIST buffer
    
    let total_sui_supply = (staker.liquid_staking_info.total_sui_supply() as u128);
    let total_lst_supply = (staker.liquid_staking_info.total_lst_supply() as u128);

    // ceil lst redemption amount for adjusted target
    let lst_to_redeem =
        ((adjusted_amount as u128) * total_lst_supply + total_sui_supply - 1) / total_sui_supply;
    let lst = balance::split(&mut staker.lst_balance, (lst_to_redeem as u64));

    let sui = liquid_staking::redeem(
        &mut staker.liquid_staking_info,
        coin::from_balance(lst, ctx),
        system_state,
        ctx,
    );

    staker.sui_balance.join(sui.into_balance());
}
```

Alternatively, query the actual fee configuration from the liquid staking protocol to calculate the exact buffer needed rather than using the maximum 5%.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
fun test_withdraw_with_fees() {
    // Setup: Create staker with 100 SUI balance and some LST
    // Configure liquid staking protocol with 1% unstake fee
    
    // Execute: User attempts to withdraw 1000 SUI
    // - Current sui_balance: 100 SUI
    // - Need to unstake: 900 SUI
    // - After 1% fee deduction: receives 891 SUI
    // - Total balance: 991 SUI
    // - Attempts to split 1000 SUI from 991 SUI
    
    // Expected: Transaction aborts with insufficient balance error
    // Actual: Transaction aborts as expected, confirming the vulnerability
}
```
