## Title
Division by Zero in `div_d()` Causes Complete Vault DoS When Share Ratio Reaches Zero

## Summary
The `div_d()` utility function lacks zero-divisor validation, and `get_share_ratio()` can legitimately return zero when the vault has outstanding shares but all asset values are zero due to underwater lending positions. This causes `execute_deposit()` to panic with division by zero at the critical share calculation step, completely blocking all deposit operations and rendering the vault inoperable.

## Finding Description

**Root Cause:**

The `div_d()` function performs division without any zero-divisor check. [1](#0-0)  When called with a zero divisor, it causes a runtime panic.

**Critical Execution Path:**

1. The `get_share_ratio()` function has an early return only when `total_shares == 0`. [2](#0-1)  When `total_shares > 0` but `total_usd_value = 0`, the function calculates the share ratio using `div_d(total_usd_value, total_shares)`. [3](#0-2)  This returns `(0 * DECIMALS) / total_shares = 0`.

2. In `execute_deposit()`, the zero share_ratio is retrieved [4](#0-3)  and then used as the divisor for calculating user shares. [5](#0-4) 

3. The division `div_d(new_usd_value_deposited, 0)` triggers a runtime panic **before** the zero-share assertion at line 848 can execute. [6](#0-5) 

**Why Total USD Value Can Reach Zero:**

Both Navi and Suilend adaptors explicitly return zero when lending positions become underwater (borrows exceed collateral):

- **Navi adaptor**: Returns 0 when `total_supply_usd_value < total_borrow_usd_value` [7](#0-6) 

- **Suilend adaptor**: Returns 0 when `total_deposited_value_usd < total_borrowed_value_usd` [8](#0-7) 

When all vault assets are deployed to underwater positions, `get_total_usd_value()` sums these zero values and returns 0. [9](#0-8) 

**Entry Point:**

Operators execute deposits through the public `operation::execute_deposit()` function [10](#0-9)  which calls the vulnerable vault function.

## Impact Explanation

**Critical Operational Impact - Complete Vault DoS:**

- All `execute_deposit()` calls abort with division by zero panic when share_ratio is zero
- The vault cannot accept any new deposits, even with valid user funds
- Users with pending deposit requests cannot have them executed; their funds remain locked in the request buffer
- Existing shareholders cannot add more capital to potentially recover the vault from underwater positions
- Protocol operators must implement emergency procedures to restore functionality
- No automatic recovery mechanism exists in the protocol

**Severity Justification:**

This is **CRITICAL** because:
1. It causes complete protocol unavailability for core deposit functionality
2. The condition occurs naturally through market volatility without requiring malicious actions
3. The failure happens at runtime panic level rather than graceful error handling
4. No protective guards prevent the zero-divisor scenario before the panic
5. The vault becomes permanently stuck until external administrative intervention

The vault status check passes normally, [11](#0-10)  but provides no protection against the zero share ratio scenario.

## Likelihood Explanation

**High Likelihood - Natural Market Conditions:**

The vulnerability triggers under realistic DeFi conditions that do not require attacker manipulation:

1. **Reachable Entry Point**: Standard vault operations allow execution through operator capabilities with proper authorization checks [12](#0-11) 

2. **Feasible Preconditions**:
   - Vault deploys funds to Navi/Suilend lending protocols (normal vault strategy)
   - Market volatility causes collateral value to drop below borrowed value
   - Lending positions become underwater (well-documented DeFi risk)
   - Adaptors legitimately return zero per their design logic

3. **No Privileged Actions Required**: Occurs through market conditions combined with normal operator deposit execution

4. **Historical Precedent**: DeFi lending positions commonly go underwater during market crashes (March 2020, May 2021, November 2022 crypto market events)

5. **Detection Difficulty**: No warning mechanism exists; the first deposit attempt post-condition results in immediate panic

## Recommendation

Add zero-divisor validation to the `div_d()` function:

```move
public fun div_d(v1: u256, v2: u256): u256 {
    assert!(v2 > 0, ERR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO);
    v1 * DECIMALS / v2
}
```

Additionally, add protective logic in `execute_deposit()` to handle the zero share ratio case gracefully before attempting the division, or prevent deposits when the vault is in an underwater state.

## Proof of Concept

The vulnerability is demonstrated through the following execution flow:

1. A vault with existing shares (total_shares > 0) deploys all assets to Navi/Suilend lending protocols
2. Market conditions cause all lending positions to become underwater (borrows > collateral)
3. Both adaptors return 0 for underwater positions per their design
4. `get_total_usd_value()` returns 0 (sum of all zero asset values)
5. `get_share_ratio()` calculates `div_d(0, total_shares)` = 0 (doesn't early return since total_shares > 0)
6. Operator attempts to execute a pending deposit via `operation::execute_deposit()`
7. At line 844 of `execute_deposit()`, the code calls `div_d(new_usd_value_deposited, 0)`
8. **Runtime panic occurs** - transaction aborts with division by zero error
9. All subsequent deposit attempts fail with the same panic until admin intervention

The panic occurs before any assertions can catch it, making the vault's deposit functionality completely unusable until the underwater positions are resolved through external means.
