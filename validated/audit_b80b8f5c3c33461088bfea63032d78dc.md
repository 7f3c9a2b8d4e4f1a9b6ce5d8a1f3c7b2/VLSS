## Title
Frozen Operators Can Bypass Freeze Control to Retrieve Deposit/Withdraw Fees

## Summary
The `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()` function does not verify whether the operator is frozen before allowing fee retrieval. This authorization bypass enables frozen operators to continue extracting protocol fees even after being explicitly disabled by the admin.

## Finding Description

The Volo vault system implements an operator freeze mechanism to revoke privileges from compromised or misbehaving operators. However, the `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()` function bypasses this critical security control.

The vulnerable function takes only an `OperatorCap` and directly calls the underlying fee retrieval function without any freeze status check: [1](#0-0) 

Critically, it does not take the `Operation` object as a parameter and therefore cannot call the freeze check function. The freeze check mechanism requires both the Operation object and OperatorCap to verify freeze status: [2](#0-1) 

In stark contrast, every other operator function throughout the codebase consistently enforces the freeze check as the first line of execution. For example, all operation lifecycle functions check freeze status: [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

All deposit and withdraw execution functions also enforce the freeze check: [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) 

The underlying `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee` function only validates version and vault status, but not operator freeze status: [9](#0-8) 

The freeze mechanism is properly defined with a freezed_operators table in the Operation struct: [10](#0-9) 

## Impact Explanation

This vulnerability represents a complete authorization bypass with **HIGH** severity impact:

**Authorization Bypass**: A frozen operator can continue to extract all accumulated deposit and withdraw fees from the vault's `deposit_withdraw_fee_collected` balance, even after being explicitly frozen by the admin.

**Security Control Violation**: The operator freeze mechanism is designed to immediately revoke ALL operator privileges when an operator is compromised or behaving maliciously. This vulnerability completely undermines that critical security control.

**Fund Loss**: Frozen operators can drain protocol treasury fees that should be under admin-only control. The admin freezes an operator specifically to prevent further actions, but the frozen operator retains the ability to extract fees.

**Who Is Affected**: 
- Protocol treasury loses accumulated fees to frozen operators
- Protocol security posture is compromised as freeze controls are ineffective

## Likelihood Explanation

The likelihood is **HIGH** because:

**Attacker Capabilities**: Requires only a valid `OperatorCap` that has been frozen. This is a realistic scenario where an operator is frozen due to suspected compromise or misbehavior.

**Attack Complexity**: Trivial - requires a single function call with no complex preconditions beyond the vault containing accumulated fees.

**Realistic Scenario**: This vulnerability is exploitable in the exact scenario where freeze controls are most critical - when an admin freezes an operator to stop malicious activity. The frozen operator can immediately call this function to extract fees before further action can be taken.

**Execution Practicality**: Fully executable under normal Sui Move semantics with no special conditions required beyond vault being in normal status.

## Recommendation

Add the `operation: &Operation` parameter to `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()` and enforce the freeze check:

```move
public fun retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator<PrincipalCoinType>(
    operation: &Operation,
    cap: &OperatorCap,
    vault: &mut Vault<PrincipalCoinType>,
    amount: u64,
): Balance<PrincipalCoinType> {
    vault::assert_operator_not_freezed(operation, cap);
    vault.retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee(amount)
}
```

This aligns the function with all other operator functions in the codebase that consistently enforce the freeze check.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
public fun test_frozen_operator_can_retrieve_fees() {
    let mut s = test_scenario::begin(OWNER);
    let mut clock = clock::create_for_testing(s.ctx());
    
    // Setup vault with accumulated fees (similar to test_set_and_retrieve_deposit_fee_from_manage_operator)
    init_vault::init_vault(&mut s, &mut clock);
    init_vault::init_create_vault<SUI_TEST_COIN>(&mut s);
    
    // Execute deposit to accumulate fees (omitted for brevity)
    // ... deposit execution that creates 10_000_000 in fees ...
    
    // Admin freezes the operator
    s.next_tx(OWNER);
    {
        let admin_cap = s.take_from_sender<AdminCap>();
        let mut operation = s.take_shared<Operation>();
        let operator_cap = s.take_from_sender<OperatorCap>();
        
        vault_manage::set_operator_freezed(
            &admin_cap,
            &mut operation,
            operator_cap.operator_id(),
            true  // Freeze the operator
        );
        
        test_scenario::return_shared(operation);
        s.return_to_sender(admin_cap);
        s.return_to_sender(operator_cap);
    };
    
    // Frozen operator can still retrieve fees - THIS SHOULD FAIL BUT SUCCEEDS
    s.next_tx(OWNER);
    {
        let operator_cap = s.take_from_sender<OperatorCap>();
        let mut vault = s.take_shared<Vault<SUI_TEST_COIN>>();
        
        let fee_retrieved = vault_manage::retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator(
            &operator_cap,
            &mut vault,
            10_000_000
        );
        assert!(fee_retrieved.value() == 10_000_000);  // Successfully retrieved despite being frozen!
        
        test_scenario::return_shared(vault);
        s.return_to_sender(operator_cap);
        fee_retrieved.destroy_for_testing();
    };
    
    clock.destroy_for_testing();
    s.end();
}
```

## Notes

The existing test suite includes `test_start_op_fail_op_freezed` which verifies that frozen operators cannot start operations: [11](#0-10) 

However, there is no test verifying that frozen operators cannot retrieve fees, which allowed this authorization bypass to remain undetected. The vulnerability is a clear deviation from the security pattern established throughout the rest of the codebase.
