## Title
Minimum Stake Amount Check Occurs Before Fee Deduction, Trapping Users in Unstakeable Positions

## Summary
The liquid staking protocol applies the `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` validation asymmetrically between stake and unstake operations. In `stake()`, the minimum check occurs on the input amount before fees are deducted, while in `unstake()`, it checks the calculated SUI output value. This creates a trap where users who stake exactly `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` (0.1 SUI) cannot immediately unstake because the post-fee LST value falls below the minimum threshold, temporarily locking their funds until staking rewards accumulate.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent application of minimum amount validation across the stake/unstake flow.

In the `stake()` function, the minimum check validates the full input amount before any fee deduction: [1](#0-0) 

However, fees are then immediately deducted from this balance using ceiling calculation: [2](#0-1) 

The protocol allows stake fees up to 5% (MAX_STAKE_FEE_BPS = 500) with ceiling calculation: [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) 

After fee deduction, the reduced balance is used to mint LST tokens: [5](#0-4) 

In contrast, the `unstake()` function checks that the calculated SUI output amount (before unstake fees) meets the minimum: [6](#0-5) 

The LST-to-SUI conversion is calculated as: [7](#0-6) 

**Execution Path:**
1. User stakes exactly 100,000,000 MIST (MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT)
2. Minimum check passes: `100,000,000 >= 100,000,000` ✓
3. With 5% stake fee: `fee = ceil(100,000,000 * 500 / 10,000) = 5,000,000 MIST`
4. Post-fee balance: `95,000,000 MIST` (now below minimum)
5. LST minted based on this reduced 95,000,000 MIST value
6. User attempts immediate unstake (before rewards accumulate)
7. LST converts to ~95,000,000 MIST worth of SUI
8. Unstake check fails: `assert!(95,000,000 >= 100,000,000)` ✗
9. Transaction aborts with `EUnderMinAmount`

## Impact Explanation

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Users who stake exactly `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` experience temporary fund lock and operational denial of service:

- **Temporary Lock**: Funds remain locked until the LST appreciates through staking rewards
- **Required Appreciation**: With 5% stake fee, users need >5.26% LST appreciation (95M → 100M MIST) before they can unstake
- **Time Duration**: Lock persists for multiple epochs (typically days to weeks) depending on staking APY
- **Affected Users**: Anyone staking precisely at the minimum threshold, particularly common for:
  - First-time users testing the protocol
  - DApp integrations programmatically using minimum amounts
  - Users wanting to stake small amounts

**Why Medium, Not High:**
- Funds are NOT permanently lost or stolen
- Users CAN eventually exit after staking rewards accumulate
- No direct protocol accounting corruption or fund theft
- However, it violates core user expectations about operational symmetry
- Creates operational DoS during the lock period
- Particularly problematic during market volatility when users need immediate liquidity

The vulnerability breaks the fundamental user expectation that "if I can stake amount X, I should be able to immediately unstake the resulting LST position."

## Likelihood Explanation

**Likelihood: HIGH**

This vulnerability is highly likely to occur in production:

**Attacker/User Capabilities:**
- No special privileges required - any user can trigger via public entry function
- No front-running, MEV, or complex transaction sequencing needed
- Simply call `stake_entry()` with exactly MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT (0.1 SUI)

**Attack Complexity:**
- Trivial: Single transaction with exact minimum amount
- No state manipulation or timing requirements
- Deterministic outcome based on fee configuration

**Feasibility Conditions:**
- Only requires non-zero stake fee to be configured (standard for production deployments generating revenue)
- Works at any time regardless of pool state, epoch, or validator status
- Fee rates up to 5% are explicitly allowed by protocol design

**Probability Factors:**
- Common user pattern to test protocols with minimum amounts
- Natural behavior for risk-averse users or integration testing
- No warning messages during stake operation
- Silent trap that only manifests on unstake attempt

## Recommendation

Apply the minimum amount check consistently across both operations. Two potential solutions:

**Option 1 (Recommended): Check post-fee amount in stake()**
Move the minimum check to after fee deduction, ensuring the actual LST-backing amount meets the minimum:

```move
// In stake() function, after fee deduction
let post_fee_balance = sui_balance.value();
assert!(post_fee_balance >= MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT, EUnderMinAmount);
```

**Option 2: Check pre-fee LST value in unstake()**
Calculate the pre-fee SUI equivalent and check against minimum plus expected fees:

```move
// In unstake() function
let pre_fee_sui_amount = sui_amount_out + expected_fee;
assert!(pre_fee_sui_amount >= MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT, EUnderMinAmount);
```

Option 1 is cleaner as it ensures the actual economic value being staked (after fees) meets the minimum threshold, preventing the trap condition entirely.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
fun test_minimum_stake_trap() {
    let mut scenario = test_scenario::begin(@0xA);
    
    // Setup: Create stake pool with 5% stake fee configured
    let admin_cap = setup_pool_with_fee(&mut scenario, 500); // 5% = 500 bps
    
    // User stakes exactly MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT (100_000_000 MIST)
    test_scenario::next_tx(&mut scenario, @0xUSER);
    {
        let mut pool = test_scenario::take_shared<StakePool>(&scenario);
        let mut metadata = test_scenario::take_shared<Metadata<CERT>>(&scenario);
        let mut system_state = test_scenario::take_shared<SuiSystemState>(&scenario);
        
        let sui_coin = coin::mint_for_testing<SUI>(100_000_000, test_scenario::ctx(&mut scenario));
        
        // Stake succeeds
        let cert = pool.stake(&mut metadata, &mut system_state, sui_coin, test_scenario::ctx(&mut scenario));
        
        // Verify LST amount is less than what would allow unstaking
        let lst_amount = coin::value(&cert);
        
        test_scenario::return_shared(pool);
        test_scenario::return_shared(metadata);
        test_scenario::return_shared(system_state);
        
        // Try to unstake immediately
        test_scenario::next_tx(&mut scenario, @0xUSER);
        {
            let mut pool = test_scenario::take_shared<StakePool>(&scenario);
            let mut metadata = test_scenario::take_shared<Metadata<CERT>>(&scenario);
            let mut system_state = test_scenario::take_shared<SuiSystemState>(&scenario);
            
            // This will abort with EUnderMinAmount (30003)
            pool.unstake(&mut metadata, &mut system_state, cert, test_scenario::ctx(&mut scenario));
            
            test_scenario::return_shared(pool);
            test_scenario::return_shared(metadata);
            test_scenario::return_shared(system_state);
        }
    };
    
    test_scenario::end(scenario);
}
```
