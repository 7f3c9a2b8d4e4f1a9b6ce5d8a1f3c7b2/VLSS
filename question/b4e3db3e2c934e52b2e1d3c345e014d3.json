  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call stake/unstake functions after a protocol upgrade but before migrate_version() is executed, bypassing new security checks by operating on old version state? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Version Downgrade] The migration allows self.version <= VERSION - can an attacker who gains package access downgrade from VERSION=2 to VERSION=1, reverting security fixes and enabling previously patched exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Race Condition] If migrate_version() is called in transaction T1 and stake() in transaction T2, can T2's check_version() pass even though StakePool logic expects old version behavior, causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Missing Validation] Does migrate_version() lack validation that critical StakePool state (fees, validator_pool, boosted_balance) is compatible with new version, potentially corrupting accounting after migration? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Unprotected State] Can migrate_version() be called multiple times unnecessarily, and does this repeated migration cause any state corruption or event emission confusion for off-chain monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Initialization] The Manage struct initializes with paused=true - can this cause DOS if StakePool is created but admin forgets to call set_paused(false), permanently locking user funds? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Replay Attack] If a malicious package upgrade sets VERSION back to an old value, can attackers replay old transactions that were valid under that version to exploit patched vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Partial Migration] If migrate_version() is called on StakePool but not on ValidatorPool (which also uses Manage), can this version mismatch enable cross-module exploits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Authorization] Does set_paused() properly validate AdminCap ownership in calling contexts, or can a package-level function bypass this by directly calling manage.set_paused() without cap checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Selective Enforcement] Are there any critical functions (collect_fees, withdraw_from_validator, rebalance) that skip check_not_paused(), allowing admin to drain funds while pool is paused for users? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker front-run set_paused(true) with a large stake() transaction, and then immediately unstake after detecting a security issue, extracting value before pause takes effect? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Migration Bypass] During migration, set_paused(false) is temporarily called - can an attacker monitor for this state change and inject malicious stake/unstake transactions during the migration window? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [State Inconsistency] If paused is set to true while there are pending validator delegations, can users' funds become stuck in an inconsistent state where they can't unstake but validators haven't activated their stakes? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Partial Pause] Does the pause only affect stake/unstake but not validator rebalancing, allowing admin to manipulate validator weights and extract value while users are locked out? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Event Missing] Does set_paused() lack proper event emission beyond SetPausedEvent, preventing off-chain systems from detecting emergency pause states and potentially missing security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Unauthorized Access] Since new() is public(package), can any module within liquid_staking package create rogue Manage instances to bypass version/pause checks in testing or malicious code paths? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Package Privilege] Being public(package), can migrate_version() be called by validator_pool or fee_config modules without AdminCap, enabling unauthorized version changes if those modules have bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Package Privilege] As public(package), can set_paused() be invoked by non-admin modules, bypassing the AdminCap requirement enforced in stake_pool::set_paused() wrapper? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Public Read] Being public, can external attackers query check_version() to determine exact protocol version and time exploits for known vulnerabilities in specific versions? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: current_version()] [Information Leak] Does exposing VERSION constant via public function enable attackers to precisely fingerprint protocol version and prepare version-specific exploits before migration? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Missing Integration] If stake_pool calls check_version() but validator_pool doesn't, can version mismatches between pools cause double-spending via delegation path vs normal stake path? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Inconsistent Checks] Does unstake() call check_not_paused() but unstake_entry() doesn't, creating an entry point bypass where paused state is ignored via direct entry function calls? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Atomic Update] If StakePool migration succeeds but subsequent FeeConfig migration fails, does the partial migration leave the protocol in an inconsistent state enabling accounting exploits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Validator Pool] When check_version() passes for StakePool but ValidatorPool still has old version, can split_n_sui() or add_stake() operate on mismatched version assumptions, corrupting delegation accounting? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Migration Timing] In import_stakes(), paused is toggled false->true - if this transaction aborts mid-execution, can the pool remain unpaused, allowing unauthorized access during incomplete migration? (High)"
