  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Reentrancy via Withdraw] Line 239 pool::withdraw_balance may call external contract if Balance<CoinType> has custom logic - can attacker re-enter withdraw_coin during balance transfer to withdraw twice? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_borrow()] [Borrow Reentrancy] Line 281 withdraws balance which may trigger callbacks - can attacker re-enter borrow_coin to borrow again before first borrow completes, doubling debt? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Liquidation Callback] Lines 447, 451 withdraw collateral and excess balances - can liquidator contract re-enter during these withdrawals to manipulate state before liquidation completes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_coin()] [Deposit Reentrancy] Line 171 splits coin via utils::split_coin_to_balance which may have side effects - can malicious coin implementation re-enter deposit_coin to inflate user's deposit balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Event Amount Accuracy] Line 196 emits deposit_amount from line 187, but actual deposited amount is from balance after split at line 171 - can these differ if balance has hooks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Withdrawable vs Requested] Line 244 emits withdrawable_amount which may be less than requested amount - do users know they received less, and can this hide partial withdrawal attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_repay()] [Repay Event Underflow] Line 333 emits repay_amount - excess_amount, but if excess_amount > repay_amount due to bug, this underflows silently - is event emission safe? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Event Price Timing] Lines 456-457 fetch prices AFTER liquidation, but emit them at line 463, 467 as if they were used in liquidation - can this mislead liquidation analysis tools? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_on_behalf_of_user()] [Dual Event Emission] Lines 193-197 emit DepositEvent in base_deposit, then line 559-564 emit DepositOnBehalfOfEvent - are two events necessary, and can this cause double-counting in indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Storage Mutation Order] Line 188 deposits to pool before line 191 executes storage update - if execute_deposit fails, is balance stuck in pool without user credit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Execute Before Withdraw] Line 229-236 executes withdraw logic before line 239 withdraws from pool - if pool withdrawal fails, is user's deposit already debited in storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_borrow()] [Debt Recording Timing] Line 279 records debt in storage before line 281 withdraws from pool - if withdrawal fails, is debt already recorded causing user to owe funds they never received? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_repay()] [Deposit Then Execute] Lines 323, 327 deposit to pool then execute repay - if execute fails, is balance locked in pool permanently? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Module: lending] [Friend Access] Lines 19-20 declare incentive_v2 and incentive_v3 as friends - can these modules abuse deposit_coin, withdraw_coin, borrow_coin, repay_coin at lines 161-307 without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_coin()] [Friend Caller Risk] Line 161 is public(friend) - can incentive_v2/v3 call this to deposit on behalf of arbitrary users without user signature? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: liquidation()] [Friend Liquidation] Line 345 is public(friend) - can friend modules liquidate positions outside normal liquidation flow, bypassing health checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: liquidation_non_entry()] [Balance Source] Line 377 liquidation_non_entry is public(friend) accepting Balance - can friend module pass arbitrary balance not backed by real deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_on_behalf_of_user()] [Friend Deposit Access] Line 555 is public(friend) - can incentive modules deposit to users without consent, manipulating their positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: repay_on_behalf_of_user()] [Friend Repay] Line 567 allows friend to repay any user's debt - can this be abused to manipulate liquidation timing or user health factors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Pool Balance Tracking] Line 188 pool::deposit_balance adds to pool, but if pool tracks total_deposits separately, can concurrent deposits cause total to exceed sum of individual deposits?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Pool Withdrawal Limit] Line 239 pool::withdraw_balance with user parameter - does pool check user's actual balance or can user withdraw beyond their deposit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_borrow()] [Pool Liquidity Check] Line 281 withdraws from pool but no explicit liquidity check - if pool is empty due to borrows, does this transaction fail gracefully or leave debt recorded? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Treasury Deposit Isolation] Line 443 pool::deposit_treasury adds to treasury balance - is treasury balance isolated from user deposits to prevent treasury funds from being borrowed?
