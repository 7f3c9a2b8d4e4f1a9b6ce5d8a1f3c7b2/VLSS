  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Upgrade Risk] The 'copy' ability means old struct instances could exist outside RequestBuffer - could stale copies be used after upgrade causing version mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Access Control] Constructor is public(package) not public(friend) - any module in volo_vault package can create requests, increasing attack surface if package contains malicious modules (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Getter Functions] [Access Control] All getters are public - should some request details be restricted to prevent information leakage that aids attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Access Control] No capability requirement to read sensitive fields - could unrestricted access to amount and expected_shares enable sophisticated MEV attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] What happens if request_id = u64::MAX and counter wraps to 0? Could cause collision with very first request if it's still pending? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] What happens if amount = 0? Could zero-amount requests cause division by zero in share calculations or fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] What happens if expected_shares = 0? Could this bypass the ERR_ZERO_SHARE check if calculated shares are also zero due to rounding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] What happens if timestamp = u64::MAX? Could overflow in cancel time check (request_time + locking_time) permanently lock the request? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Edge Case] What happens if all addresses (receipt_id, recipient, vault_id) are the same? Could this cause unexpected behavior in identity checks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Edge Case] What happens if amount is very small (e.g., 1) and expected_shares is very large (e.g., u256::MAX)? Could this cause share ratio manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [DoS] No limit on request_id growth - could attacker spam requests to exhaust deposit_id_count and cause counter overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [DoS] No expiration mechanism - could old requests accumulate in Table indefinitely, causing unbounded storage growth and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [DoS] Could attacker create many requests with unsatisfiable expected_shares to fill buffer with unexecutable requests, blocking legitimate deposits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [DoS] Could attacker create requests with expected_shares = u256::MAX to guarantee slippage violations, forcing permanent coin lock and operator griefing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Reentrancy] Constructor has no reentrancy protection - could malicious code in address parameters trigger callbacks during construction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Getter Functions] [Reentrancy] Public getters could be called during vault state transitions - could reentrancy via getters expose intermediate state and enable exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Price Manipulation] The expected_shares is based on share ratio at request time - could oracle price manipulation between request and execution cause all pending deposits to fail slippage check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Price Manipulation] No oracle price snapshot in struct - could attacker manipulate oracle price before execute_deposit to extract maximum slippage from expected_shares constraint? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Precision Loss] Amount is u64 but expected_shares is u256 - could type mismatch in calculations cause precision loss or rounding errors favoring attacker? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Rounding] No rounding mode specified for expected_shares calculation - could rounding differences between request and execution cause systematic slippage violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Fee Manipulation] Amount doesn't account for fees - could amount field being pre-fee or post-fee cause confusion and enable fee bypass exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Fee Manipulation] Expected_shares doesn't reflect fee impact - could attacker set expected_shares assuming no fees to bypass fee collection during execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Flash Loan Attack] Two-step deposit process (request then execute) prevents atomic flash loan attacks - but could attacker use flash loan to manipulate vault state between request and execution to fail slippage check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Atomic Attack] Struct has copy ability - could attacker use PTB (Programmable Transaction Block) to copy request and perform atomic manipulations before execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Gas Griefing] Public getters enable cheap state reads - could attacker spam getter calls to degrade node performance? (Low)"
