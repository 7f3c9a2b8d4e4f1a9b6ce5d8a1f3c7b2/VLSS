  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Validation] The validate() function is completely empty with no validation logic. Can an attacker exploit this to set arbitrary guardian_queue_id values (including zero address, non-existent IDs, or malicious queue IDs) that could compromise oracle security, since no preconditions are checked before the state mutation in actuate()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Input Validation] The validate() function performs no checks on the guardian_queue_id parameter. Can an admin accidentally or maliciously set the guardian_queue_id to ID zero (0x0...0), which would disable guardian queue oversight and allow unverified oracle updates to proceed without security checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Existence Check] The validate() function does not verify that the guardian_queue_id corresponds to an actual Queue object on-chain. Can an admin set a non-existent or deleted Queue ID as the guardian queue, causing all subsequent oracle operations requiring guardian verification to fail with runtime errors and creating a DoS condition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Type Check] The validate() function does not verify that the guardian_queue_id points to a Queue object with is_guardian_queue=true. Can an admin mistakenly set a regular oracle queue as the guardian queue, bypassing the security model where guardian queues should have special permissions and stricter validation rules? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing State Check] The validate() function does not check the current state.guardian_queue value before allowing changes. Can an admin repeatedly change the guardian queue in rapid succession during active oracle operations, potentially causing oracle feeds to reference inconsistent guardian queue states and producing incorrect price data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Timelock] The validate() function imposes no delay or timelock on guardian queue changes. Can a compromised admin immediately switch to a malicious guardian queue and then manipulate oracle prices within the same transaction/epoch, bypassing any monitoring or emergency response mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Same-Value Check] The validate() function does not prevent setting the guardian_queue_id to the same value it already has. Can this lead to unnecessary state writes, event emissions, and gas waste, or be exploited to spam events and obscure legitimate guardian queue changes in event logs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Multi-Sig Requirement] The validate() function requires only a single AdminCap holder to change the guardian queue. For such a critical security parameter, should there be multi-signature approval or time-delayed governance to prevent single-point-of-compromise risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Insufficient Authorization] The run() function only checks for AdminCap ownership via the underscore parameter but doesn't verify the admin's identity or permissions level. Can any holder of any AdminCap (if multiple exist or if AdminCap is cloned/shared improperly) change the guardian queue without additional verification? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cap Validation] The run() function uses '_' to ignore the AdminCap parameter without any validation of its authenticity. If the AdminCap can be forged, cloned, or if multiple AdminCaps exist from different deployment contexts, can an attacker gain unauthorized access to change the guardian queue? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Missing Cap-State Binding] The run() function doesn't verify that the AdminCap provided belongs to the same deployment/module as the State object being modified. In a multi-deployment scenario, can an admin from a different Switchboard deployment use their AdminCap to modify this State object's guardian queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Public Entry Risk] The run() function is declared as 'public entry', making it callable from any transaction. Should there be additional access control layers (like pausable flags or emergency mode checks) to prevent guardian queue changes during critical system operations or security incidents? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Unchecked State Mutation] The actuate() function directly calls on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id without any pre-mutation validation. If the State object is in an inconsistent state (e.g., partially initialized, corrupted, or mid-operation), can this state mutation cause downstream oracle operations to fail or produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Rollback Mechanism] The actuate() function permanently changes the guardian_queue field with no built-in rollback or recovery mechanism. If the new guardian_queue_id is set incorrectly (invalid, malicious, or misconfigured), what is the recovery process, and could there be a window where oracle operations are broken or exploitable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Atomic Operation Assumption] The actuate() function assumes the state mutation and event emission are atomic. In Sui's execution model, if the transaction fails after set_guardian_queue_id but before event emission, could the state be changed without proper event logging, breaking auditability and monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No State Lock] The actuate() function modifies shared State without checking if other operations are in progress. Can concurrent transactions reading the guardian_queue value experience race conditions or observe inconsistent state during the guardian queue transition? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] The actuate() function emits the GuardianQueueIdSet event after the state mutation. If monitoring systems process events with delay and a subsequent operation reads the new guardian_queue_id before the event is indexed, can this create temporal inconsistencies in off-chain monitoring and alerting systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Integrity] The actuate() function constructs the event using state.guardian_queue() before the mutation. If the on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id call fails internally or partially completes, could the event emit incorrect old_guardian_queue_id values that don't match the actual state transition? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: GuardianQueueIdSet] [Event Visibility] The GuardianQueueIdSet event only contains old and new guardian_queue_id values without timestamp, admin address, or transaction context. Can this make it difficult to audit who made the change, when, and under what circumstances, hindering security investigations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: GuardianQueueIdSet] [Missing Metadata] The GuardianQueueIdSet event doesn't include a reason or justification field. In a security incident investigation, how can auditors determine whether a guardian queue change was legitimate maintenance or part of an attack without additional context in the event? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No ID Format Validation] The run() function accepts an ID parameter without validating its format or structure. Can an attacker pass a malformed ID that causes the on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id call to panic or produce undefined behavior in downstream operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Circular Reference Check] The run() function doesn't prevent setting the guardian_queue_id to reference itself or create circular dependencies. Can this cause infinite loops or stack overflows in oracle verification logic that recursively checks guardian queue relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Object Ownership Check] The actuate() function doesn't verify that the guardian_queue_id points to a shared or properly accessible Queue object. Can setting a guardian_queue_id that points to a private or wrapped object cause all guardian-queue-dependent operations to fail with access violations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy via Event] The run() function calls actuate() which emits an event. While Sui Move generally prevents classic reentrancy, can the event emission trigger external contract hooks or callbacks that could observe and exploit the intermediate state between guardian queue changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Execution Order Dependency] The run() function calls validate() before actuate(), but validate() is empty. If validate() is meant to be implemented in the future, could the current code create execution flow vulnerabilities where state mutations happen before proper validation is added? (Medium)"
