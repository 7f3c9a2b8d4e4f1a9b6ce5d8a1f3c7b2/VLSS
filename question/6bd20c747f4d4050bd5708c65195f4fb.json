  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Operation Status] Can oracle_queue_id be changed while vault status is 'during_operation', potentially causing the operation to use inconsistent oracle data halfway through? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Calculation] Does changing oracle_queue_id affect how vault fees are calculated in USD terms? Can this be exploited to underpay or overpay fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [LST Ratio Impact] Can oracle_queue_id changes affect SUI/LST exchange ratio calculations if liquid staking relies on oracle prices for any validation or accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Epoch Rollover] If oracle_queue_id changes during liquid staking epoch rollover, can this cause reward calculation errors or validator delegation issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validator Weights] If validator weight calculations use oracle price data, can oracle_queue_id changes cause incorrect weight updates or delegation imbalances? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Operator Confusion] Does the system distinguish between operator and admin roles? Can an operator mistakenly be granted AdminCap and call run() when they should only have limited vault operation privileges? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cap Transfer] If AdminCap is transferred to a new address, can the old admin still have a pending transaction calling run() that executes after the transfer, bypassing the intended access revocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Social Engineering] Can an attacker social engineer an admin into signing a transaction calling run() with a malicious oracle_queue_id by disguising it as a legitimate oracle upgrade? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event-State Mismatch] Can there be a scenario where OracleQueueIdSet event shows different oracle_queue_id values than what actually got written to State due to race conditions or transaction ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: OracleQueueIdSet] [ID Size] Are there any constraints on ID type size or format? Can extremely large or specially crafted IDs cause overflow or parsing errors in event processing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Getter Reliability] Does state.oracle_queue() always return the current value, or could it be stale due to caching? Can this cause old_oracle_queue_id in events to be incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Module: set_oracle_queue_id_action] [Package Upgrade] If the switchboard package is upgraded, can the new version break compatibility with this action module, causing run() to fail or behave incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Migration Path] During a migration from old to new Switchboard oracle system, can run() safely handle transitioning between different Queue implementations or versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Deprecation] If this action module is deprecated, can old oracle_queue_id values still be read correctly by new code, or will migration cause data loss? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can an attacker use a flash loan to temporarily obtain assets that allow them to gain AdminCap access (through a complex exploit chain), call run(), then return the assets all in one transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Contract Call] Can run() be called from within another contract's function in a way that bypasses expected authorization flows or creates unexpected state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Callback Exploit] If any part of run(), actuate(), or on_demand::set_oracle_queue_id() triggers callbacks to external contracts, can those callbacks reenter and call run() again with different parameters?
