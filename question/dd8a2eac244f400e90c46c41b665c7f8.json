  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Skip Optimization] The continue statement at line 60 skips zero-balance reserves - but get_asset_price() at line 63 is still called even when not needed - is this wasteful? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Redundant Calls] Can an attacker repeatedly call update_navi_position_value() with the same asset_type to waste gas and potentially front-run legitimate updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Decimal Mismatch] Ray math uses 27 decimals, oracle prices use 18 decimals, and asset amounts use 9 decimals - are all conversions at lines 53-54 and 65-66 handled correctly without precision loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Rounding Direction] When mul_with_oracle_price() divides by ORACLE_DECIMALS at lines 65-66, does rounding down benefit attackers by undervaluing positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Small Balance Loss] For very small supply or borrow amounts, could precision loss in ray_mul() at lines 53-54 or mul_with_oracle_price() at lines 65-66 cause them to round to 0? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Navi Protocol Upgrade] If Navi's lending_core is upgraded and storage.get_user_balance() signature changes, will this adaptor break? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Dynamic Calculator Trust] The dynamic_calculator module at lines 48-52 is trusted to calculate correct indexes - if it has bugs, can incorrect position values be computed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Ray Math Dependency] ray_math::ray_mul() at lines 53-54 is a critical external dependency - if it has overflow bugs, can this adaptor be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Vault Module Trust] get_defi_asset() and finish_update_asset_value() are vault module functions - if the vault module has bugs, can this adaptor's security be compromised? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Reserve Addition] If new reserves are added to Navi storage after get_reserves_count() is called at line 37, will they be missed in the valuation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Reserve Removal] If reserves are removed from Navi during the loop, could get_user_balance() at line 44 access invalid indexes causing reverts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Empty Reserves] If get_reserves_count() returns 0 at line 37, the function immediately returns 0 (lines 39-40 initialized to 0) - is this distinguishable from a position with 0 value? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Mixed Positions] If an account has both supply and borrow in the same reserve, are they netted correctly, or could accounting errors occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Borrow-Only Position] If an account only has borrows (supply = 0), the net value will be 0 at line 75 - but should this be treated as a liability instead? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Supply-Only Position] If an account only has supplies (borrow = 0), does the skip logic at lines 58-61 incorrectly skip it? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Config Change] If the OracleConfig is modified (e.g., aggregators changed) between when update_navi_position_value() is called and when calculate_navi_position_value() executes, can inconsistent prices be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Update Interval Manipulation] If the OracleConfig's update_interval is increased by an admin right before an update, can stale prices pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Zero Return] The function returns 0 in two cases: underwater position (line 75) and no reserves (implicit). How does the caller distinguish between these cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Maximum Return] Is there a maximum possible return value, or could extremely large positions cause u256 to be exceeded somewhere in the calculation chain? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [String Injection] The asset_type parameter at line 18 is a String - can an attacker inject special characters or long strings to cause parsing errors or DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [String Comparison] Are asset_type string comparisons case-sensitive? Could 'NaviAccountCap1' vs 'naviacountcap1' cause lookup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Concurrent Updates] If multiple transactions call update_navi_position_value() for different assets concurrently, can race conditions corrupt the vault's total value tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Storage Race] If Navi's storage is updated (e.g., user deposits/withdraws) while calculate_navi_position_value() is iterating reserves, can inconsistent values be computed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Partial Failure] If calculate_navi_position_value() fails partway through, does the transaction revert cleanly, or could the vault be left in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Error Propagation] If any of the external calls (get_user_balance, calculate_current_index, get_coin_type, get_asset_price) abort, how is the error propagated to the caller? (Medium)"
