  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Multi-Step Claim] Function performs multiple state updates - if any step fails, are previous steps rolled back atomically? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [External Storage Call] Line 251 calls external storage module - could storage module call back into incentive causing reentrancy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Balance Split Timing] Line 335 splits balance after state updates - could this enable drain attacks if claim is called recursively? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: init()] [Single Initialization] init creates one shared Incentive - could multiple initializations create parallel incentive systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: init()] [Creator Privilege] Creator gets permanent control - is there any mechanism to transfer creator role? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: init_for_testing()] [Test Function Exposure] init_for_testing is public - could this be called in production to create test incentive objects? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveOwnerCap] [Unused Capability] IncentiveOwnerCap is defined but never used in functions - is this dead code or missing functionality? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveAdminCap] [Unused Capability] IncentiveAdminCap is defined but never checked in functions - are caps meant to gate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveOwnerCap] [Cap Creation] No function creates IncentiveOwnerCap - how are caps distributed and could attackers mint fake caps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: set_owner()] [Event Only Logging] Lines 106-109 emit event but don't enforce any on-chain consequence - could events be spoofed? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: set_admin()] [Event Content] Event includes sender but sender is already known as creator - is redundant data exploitable? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Missing Event] add_pool doesn't emit event - could lack of events hide malicious pool additions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Missing Event] No event emitted on successful claim - could this hide reward theft? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Rate Precision] Line 167 uses ray_div for high precision - but could precision loss accumulate over many reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Ray Division Rounding] Line 329 divides by ray() - does rounding always favor protocol or could users lose dust amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Integer Division] Line 255 performs integer division - could rounding cause cumulative reward loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Asset ID Collision] Multiple assets use u8 ID - only 256 possible assets, could ID exhaustion or reuse cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Asset Isolation] Function updates single asset - are rewards properly isolated between different assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Assets Vector] assets vector tracks which assets have pools - could removing pools leave stale entries causing memory leak? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Oracle ID Storage] Line 172 stores oracle_id but never validates it - could invalid oracle_id cause downstream failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_pool_info()] [Oracle ID Return] Line 356 returns oracle_id - how is this ID used and could returning wrong ID cause oracle manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: earned()] [Oracle IDs Vector] Line 388 returns oracle_ids - are these IDs used to price rewards and could mismatch cause incorrect valuations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Early User Advantage] First users get rewards before total_supply grows - could early entrants extract disproportionate rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Update Timing] Rewards only update when update_reward is called - could users who never trigger updates lose rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Claim Timing] Users can claim anytime - could optimal claiming times be exploited for maximum rewards? (Low)"
