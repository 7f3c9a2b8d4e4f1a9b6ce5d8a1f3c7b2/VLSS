  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: Missing] [Checked Cast] No functions to safely cast between u256/u128/u64 - can downcasting in vault code silently truncate values causing accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: Missing] [Mul Div] Without atomic mul_div(a,b,c) = a*b/c that checks intermediate overflow, can two-step operations overflow unnecessarily? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: Missing] [Average] Without safe average((a+b)/2), can implementations overflow on the addition step even when average would fit? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Type Flexibility] All functions use u256 - can this force unnecessary type conversions from u64/u128 in calling code, introducing conversion vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Public Visibility] All functions are public - should some be restricted to prevent misuse by external contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [No Events] Math operations don't emit events - can overflow attempts go undetected, preventing security monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Error Codes] Error codes are defined but never used in logs - can this make debugging production issues difficult when math operations fail? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Generic Types] Functions are not generic - can this prevent reuse with phantom types or custom numeric types used in Sui? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()] [Early Return] The early return when a==0 optimizes one case - can this create timing side-channels revealing information about transaction amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Inline] Functions are not marked inline - can this cause extra call overhead in tight loops like batch processing of validator stakes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()] [Native Operation] Division is already checked by Move VM - is the explicit b > 0 check redundant and wasting gas? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Documentation] Comments only describe return values, not preconditions or invariants - can this lead to misuse by developers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Test Coverage] No tests are visible in this file - can untested edge cases lead to vulnerabilities in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Version Control] This is in local_dependencies - can drift from upstream protocol math library introduce security regressions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()/div()/add()] [Share Inflation Attack] Can an attacker donate assets to vault, then use precision loss in mul()/div() to inflate their share value, then withdraw to steal from other depositors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: add()/sub()] [Flash Loan] Can attacker use flash loan to inflate vault balance temporarily, causing add() operations to overflow for legitimate users during the loan period, DoS-ing deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()] [First Depositor] When vault is empty, can first depositor exploit div() rounding to deposit 1 wei, donate massive amount, then subsequent depositors get 0 shares due to rounding? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()/div()] [Sandwich Attack] Can attacker sandwich user's deposit between large deposit+withdraw to manipulate share price via mul()/div() precision, stealing value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: sub()] [Reentrancy] If sub() is used in withdraw flow before external call, can reentrant call modify balances making sub() operate on stale values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: All] [Oracle Manipulation] Can attacker manipulate Switchboard oracle prices to cause mul() overflows specifically for high-value assets, preventing liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()/mul()] [MEV] Can MEV bots exploit rounding in div() to front-run user withdrawals, taking the favorable rounding and leaving users with unfavorable rounding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: add()] [Epoch Boundary] Can attacker time large stake transactions at epoch boundary to cause add() overflow during reward distribution, preventing rewards for all users? (High)"
