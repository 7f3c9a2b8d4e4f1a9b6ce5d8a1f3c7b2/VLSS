  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker front-run the init() function deployment to claim OracleAdminCap and OracleFeederCap before the legitimate deployer, gaining full oracle control? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: create_feeder()] [Capability Proliferation] Can OracleAdminCap holder create unlimited OracleFeederCap instances without tracking, allowing compromised feeders to persist undetected after a security incident? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: create_feeder()] [Access Control] Is there a mechanism to revoke or burn OracleFeederCap after creation, or can a malicious feeder maintain price update privileges indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: OracleAdminCap] [Capability Transfer] Can OracleAdminCap be transferred to an untrusted party via public_transfer, and does the protocol have safeguards against accidental or malicious admin transfers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: OracleFeederCap] [Capability Leak] Since OracleFeederCap has store ability, can it be placed in shared objects or wrapped in custom structs to bypass intended access patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization Race] If init() is called multiple times in different transactions, will multiple PriceOracle shared objects be created, fragmenting the oracle state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: create_feeder()] [DoS via Cap Spam] Can an attacker with OracleAdminCap spam create_feeder() calls to create thousands of feeder caps, causing storage bloat or gas exhaustion for legitimate operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: version_verification()] [Version Bypass] If version_verification() only checks pre_check_version but doesn't enforce exact version match, can an oracle with outdated version be used with newer protocol logic causing inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Migration DoS] Since version_migrate() entry function always aborts with 0, can this be exploited to permanently prevent version upgrades if users accidentally call it instead of oracle_version_migrate()? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_version_migrate()] [Version Downgrade] Does the assertion oracle.version <= this_version() allow downgrading version from higher to current, potentially reverting critical security patches? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_version_migrate()] [Friend Access Abuse] Since oracle_version_migrate() is friend-only, can malicious friend modules (oracle_pro/oracle_manage) trigger premature or unauthorized migrations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_version_migrate()] [Reentrancy] Can oracle_version_migrate() be called multiple times in a single transaction via friend modules to cause version increment beyond this_version()? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: version_verification()] [Missing Version Check] Do all public entry functions call version_verification(), or can some functions be accessed with outdated oracle versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Staleness Manipulation] Can OracleAdminCap holder set update_interval to u64::MAX to effectively disable staleness checks, allowing prices to remain valid indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Zero Interval Attack] The assertion checks update_interval > 0, but can setting it to 1 millisecond cause all prices to be immediately stale, DoS'ing price-dependent operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Race Condition] If set_update_interval() is called while get_token_price() is being executed, can the staleness check use inconsistent interval values causing incorrect valid/invalid determinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Event Missing] No event is emitted when update_interval changes, making it impossible to audit interval modifications that could mask price manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [No Upper Bound] Is there a maximum limit on update_interval to prevent setting absurdly long staleness windows (years/decades) that undermine price freshness guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Decimal Overflow] With price_decimal capped at 16 and token_price being u256, can extreme price values (e.g., 2^256-1) with max decimals cause overflow in downstream calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Price Zero Registration] Can token_price be set to 0 during registration, and would this break get_token_price() validity logic that requires value > 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Decimal Boundary] The assertion checks price_decimal > 0 and <= 16, but can price_decimal of 1 cause precision loss for high-value tokens requiring more decimals? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Oracle ID Collision] Can oracle_id be reused after a token is de-registered (if de-registration exists), potentially confusing price consumers expecting different tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Is clock timestamp_ms trusted, or can a malicious validator manipulate clock to register prices with future/past timestamps affecting staleness checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [No Price Validation] Can arbitrarily large or suspiciously small token_price values be registered without sanity checks, enabling immediate price manipulation on new tokens? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Already Exist Bypass] The assertion prevents duplicate oracle_id registration, but can the same token be registered under multiple IDs to fragment price feeds? (Low)"
