  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Slothash Validation] Does the function ensure slothash corresponds to a valid Solana slot, or can arbitrary values be used to fake blockchain state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Field Order Dependency] Could reordering attestation fields (oracle_key, queue_key, mr_enclave, slothash, secp256k1_key, timestamp) create valid-looking but unverifiable messages? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Key Format Ambiguity] Can the 64-byte secp256k1_key represent both compressed and uncompressed formats, causing signature verification to fail unpredictably? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Integer Overflow] Can start_idx + v2.length() overflow u64 bounds, causing the length check to incorrectly pass and leading to out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Boundary Condition] If v1.length() exactly equals start_idx + v2.length(), does the function correctly validate, or could off-by-one errors cause false positives? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Empty Vector Handling] Can v2 be empty (length 0), and does the function return true trivially, potentially bypassing validation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Loop Underflow] The loop uses 'iterations - 1' for indexing; can this underflow when iterations=0 is reached, causing incorrect comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Index Calculation] Does the expression 'start_idx + idx' correctly handle all valid u64 ranges, or could large indices cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Early Return Logic] The function returns false on length mismatch, but does it short-circuit properly to avoid unnecessary iterations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: check_subvec()] [Access Pattern] Can the reverse iteration pattern (from end to start) cause cache misses or performance degradation in large vector comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg()] [Test Vector Validity] Are the hardcoded test values (queue_key, feed_hash, slothash) representative of production data, or could tests pass while production fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg()] [Decimal Value Range] The test uses a very large decimal value (226943873990930561085963032052770576810); can this cause overflow in actual oracle price processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg()] [BCS Encoding Assumption] The test compares raw BCS encoding against message components; could BCS format changes break this validation approach? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg_ecrecover()] [Signature Verification] Does the test verify that ecrecover works correctly, or could the hardcoded signature be invalid but tests still pass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg_ecrecover()] [Public Key Decompression] Can the decompress_pubkey step fail or return wrong results for edge-case signatures, allowing invalid oracle updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_update_msg_ecrecover()] [Expected Signer Validation] The test checks a subvector starting at index 1, not 0; could this miss validation issues in the first byte of the public key? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_attestation_msg()] [Attestation Field Validation] Do the test vectors use realistic mr_enclave and secp256k1_key values, or could attackers exploit differences between test and production environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: test_check_subvec()] [Assertion Failure Handling] If the assertion fails, does it provide enough context to debug which byte mismatched, or could this hide subtle hash construction bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Cross-Function] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker mix push_u32() and push_u32_le() in the same message to create hash collisions by exploiting endianness differences? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Cross-Function] [Message Ambiguity] Since push_bytes() doesn't include length prefixes, can an attacker craft messages where 32-byte keys blend with decimal values, causing parsing errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Cross-Function] [Hasher Reuse] Can a single Hasher instance be used for both generate_update_msg and generate_attestation_msg, causing field contamination? (Medium)",
