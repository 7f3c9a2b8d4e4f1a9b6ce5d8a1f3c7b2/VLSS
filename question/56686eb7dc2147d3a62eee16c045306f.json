  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_user_reward_manager()] [Cumulative Rewards Per Share] At line 311, cumulative_rewards_per_share is copied from pool_reward. If this value is very large and user share is also large, can multiplication at lines 303-306 overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_user_reward_manager()] [Late Joiner Advantage] At lines 300-309, if a user joins after start_time_ms but the pool had zero shares initially, do they get full historical rewards due to the cumulative_rewards_per_share multiplication? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Claim Timing] A user can wait until just before end_time_ms to claim, getting all accumulated rewards at once. Can this create unfair advantage over users who claim incrementally due to rounding differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Partial Claims] At line 384-386, only floored amount is claimed and decimal remainder stays in earned_rewards. Can an attacker accumulate many small decimal remainders across campaigns to extract value? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_user_reward_manager()] [Counter Increment] At line 315, num_user_reward_managers is incremented when creating a new UserReward. Can this counter overflow if billions of users join, causing it to wrap to 0 and allowing premature pool_reward closure? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Counter Decrement] At line 399, num_user_reward_managers is decremented when campaign ends. If this counter is already 0 due to a bug, can the decrement underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: close_pool_reward()] [Counter Verification] At line 160, num_user_reward_managers must be 0. Can desynchronization between actual UserReward count and this counter cause either premature closure or permanent lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_pool_reward_manager()] [Allocated vs Total] The invariant is that allocated_rewards <= total_rewards. Can rounding errors in cumulative additions at line 244 violate this, causing close_pool_reward to panic when calculating unallocated rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: cancel_pool_reward()] [Total Rewards Reset] At line 194, total_rewards is set to 0 while allocated_rewards remains. Does this break the invariant that total_rewards >= allocated_rewards for subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: change_user_reward_manager_share()] [Total Shares Invariant] The invariant is that sum of all user shares equals total_shares. Can concurrent modifications or rounding errors cause this to desynchronize, leading to incorrect reward distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_pool_reward_manager()] [Decimal Conversion] At lines 237-242, integers are converted to Decimals for calculation. Can precision be lost when converting large u64 values, causing rewards to be systematically underpaid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_user_reward_manager()] [Decimal Subtraction] At line 320-322, sub() is used on cumulative_rewards_per_share values. If these values are equal or very close, can precision errors cause sub() to return negative values or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: update_user_reward_manager()] [Decimal Multiplication] At lines 319-325 and 303-306, decimal multiplication with user share is performed. Can this lose precision when share is very large or very small? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Floor Operation] At line 384, floor() converts Decimal to u64. For rewards in tokens with high decimals, can repeated floor operations cause significant value loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/liquidity_mining.move] [Function: cancel_pool_reward()] [Floor Unallocated] At line 186, floor() is used on the difference between total and allocated rewards. Can this systematically favor the protocol by always rounding down user rewards? (Medium)"
