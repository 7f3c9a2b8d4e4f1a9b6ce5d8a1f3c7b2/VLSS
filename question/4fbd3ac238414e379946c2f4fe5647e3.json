  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Mutable Variables] Lines 39-40 declare mutable variables initialized to 0 - could forgetting to initialize them correctly in a future code change cause critical bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Loop Counter] The loop counter 'i' is mutable at line 37 - could any code path fail to decrement it, causing an infinite loop? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Cast to u256] Lines 65-66 cast 'supply_scaled as u256' and 'borrow_scaled as u256' - but they're already u256 from ray_mul(), so is this redundant or hiding a bug? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [TODO Implementation] The TODO comment at line 46 indicates uncertainty about using dynamic vs static index - if the decision is wrong, could this cause systematic over/under-valuation of positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Comment Accuracy] Line 42 comments 'i: asset id' - but 'i' actually represents the reserve count initially, then iterates down - is this misleading? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Config Staleness] The OracleConfig passed at line 15 is assumed valid - but if it's corrupted or outdated, can incorrect prices be used? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Config Version] Does the OracleConfig have version checks? If not, could an outdated config be used with incompatible code? (Medium)"
