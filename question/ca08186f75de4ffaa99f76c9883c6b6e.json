  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Authorization Bypass] Can package-level visibility allow unauthorized modules to call migrate_version() if they're in the same package, enabling version manipulation without AdminCap check? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Logic Error] Does the <= comparison in migrate_version() allow downgrade attacks where self.version > VERSION could pass the check if VERSION constant is decreased in future deployments? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [State Inconsistency] Can migrate_version() be called multiple times in succession without side effects, and does this enable DoS or state corruption when combined with other operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Race Condition] If migrate_version() is called while other operations are in progress, can it cause version check failures mid-transaction for concurrent operations reading the version field? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Validation Bypass] Can an attacker exploit timing between check_version() calls in parent modules to execute operations after version is changed but before migration completes? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Logic Error] Does check_version() using strict equality (==) prevent legitimate forward compatibility scenarios where version > VERSION should be acceptable? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Upgrade Safety] If VERSION is changed from 2 to 3 in a new deployment, will existing pools with version=2 become permanently locked until migrate_version() is called? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Integer Overflow] Can self.version be manipulated to near u64::MAX before migration, causing integer overflow when compared to VERSION or in future version arithmetic? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Authorization Bypass] Since set_paused() has package visibility, can any module in liquid_staking package call it directly, bypassing AdminCap requirements enforced only in stake_pool.move? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [State Manipulation] Can set_paused() be called repeatedly to toggle pause state rapidly, causing DoS or breaking assumptions in modules that cache pause state? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Race Condition] Between check_not_paused() call and actual operation execution, can set_paused(true) be called in another transaction to cause operations to complete while system should be paused? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Logic Error] Does check_not_paused() abort with EIncompatiblePaused (50002) providing enough context, or could this error code collision with other modules cause confusion in error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Initial State] Why is paused=true in new() constructor, and can this cause locked funds if deployment doesn't immediately call set_paused(false)? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Missing Validation] Does set_paused() lack checks for current pause state, enabling idempotent calls that could mask errors or enable event replay attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Access Control] Since new() has package visibility, can malicious package modules create arbitrary Manage instances with paused=true to inject into other data structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [State Inconsistency] Does new() always initializing paused=true create deployment risks where pools are created but cannot be used until admin manually unpauses? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Version Initialization] Can new() be called with outdated VERSION constant if module is not fully redeployed, causing version mismatches between Manage instances? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: EIncompatibleVersion] [Error Code Collision] Can error code 50001 collide with error codes in other modules, causing incorrect error interpretation in multi-module transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: EIncompatiblePaused] [Error Code Collision] Can error code 50002 collide with other pause-related errors in volo_vault or validator_pool modules? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Error Message] Does assert!(self.version == VERSION, EIncompatibleVersion) provide enough information for debugging version mismatch issues in production? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Error Message] Does assert!(!self.paused, EIncompatiblePaused) clearly communicate why operation failed, or can users confuse pause with other operational states? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Composition Pattern] Can Manage struct be embedded in multiple pool types (StakePool, ValidatorPool), and does this create inconsistent pause states across pools? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Cross-Module Consistency] If StakePool and ValidatorPool have different Manage instances with different versions, can this cause inconsistent behavior in integrated operations? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [State Synchronization] When set_paused() is called on StakePool's Manage, does ValidatorPool's Manage pause state remain independent, enabling partial system pause vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Package Visibility] [Scope Creep] Can future modules added to liquid_staking package abuse package-level access to new(), set_paused(), and migrate_version() without proper authorization? (Medium)"
