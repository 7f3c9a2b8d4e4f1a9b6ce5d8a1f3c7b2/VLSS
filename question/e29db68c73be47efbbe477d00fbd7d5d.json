  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: init()] [Witness Risk] The init() function receives POSITION witness but aborts - if module upgrade provides real init(), could multiple initializations be triggered, creating duplicate module-level state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: is_empty()] [DoS Risk] If is_empty() is called in a loop over many positions (e.g., during batch operations), will all calls aborting cause transaction failure, DoSing vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: reward_length()] [DoS Risk] If reward_length() is called to iterate over rewards but aborts, will any reward distribution operations fail completely, locking user rewards indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Gas Exhaustion Risk] Position contains variable-length reward_infos vector - if the real implementation allows unlimited vector growth, could positions with thousands of rewards cause gas exhaustion when accessed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Fee Rate Gaming Risk] If fee_rate is stored per-position rather than per-pool, could users create multiple positions with different fee rates, gaming fee collection to minimize payments? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Liquidity Fragmentation Risk] If users can create many tiny positions with min liquidity, could this fragment pool liquidity, making it expensive to update all positions during vault value updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: owed_coin_x(), owed_coin_y()] [Fee Harvesting Attack Risk] If owed coins can be queried without updating position state, could attackers monitor owed fees and frontrun collect operations to steal MEV? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: liquidity.move] [Open Position Risk] Since liquidity::open_position() (which also aborts) should create Position objects, if vault code assumes position creation succeeds, will all open_position calls fail causing vault deposits to revert? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: liquidity.move] [Close Position Risk] Since liquidity::close_position() (which also aborts) should destroy Position, if vault attempts to remove positions, will all close operations fail, permanently locking positions in vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: liquidity.move] [Add Liquidity Risk] Since liquidity::add_liquidity() aborts, if vault strategies attempt to compound earnings into positions, will all compounding operations fail, leaving earned fees unclaimed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: liquidity.move] [Remove Liquidity Risk] Since liquidity::remove_liquidity() aborts, if vault needs to remove liquidity for user withdrawals, will all withdrawal operations involving Momentum positions fail permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: collect.move] [Fee Collection Risk] If collect.move has corresponding fee collection functions that depend on Position state, will these also abort, preventing any fee harvesting from Momentum positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Type Erasure Risk] Position stores TypeName for type_x and type_y instead of phantom types - could this enable type confusion where Position<SUI, USDC> is used as Position<USDC, SUI>, inverting price calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: All Getters] [Type Safety Risk] Getters don't use generics to enforce type checking - if Position is used with wrong Pool<X,Y> types, will runtime type mismatches be caught, or could this cause silent calculation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [UID Management Risk] Position has id: UID field - if real implementation allows id to be modified or swapped, could positions be duplicated or stolen by ID manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Object Deletion Risk] Position has 'key' ability - if vault deletes Position objects without proper cleanup (e.g., not collecting owed fees first), will fees be permanently lost? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Dynamic Field Risk] Position has UID which can store dynamic fields - if the real implementation adds sensitive data as dynamic fields, could vault operations fail to account for this extra value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: All Getters] [Reentrancy Risk] If getters are called during position modification operations, could reentrancy between vault and liquidity operations cause inconsistent state reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Atomic Update Risk] Position has multiple fee/reward fields that must be updated atomically - if the real implementation updates these fields in separate steps, could partial updates corrupt accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Liquidity Addition Overflow Risk] If add_liquidity increments Position.liquidity without checked addition, could liquidity overflow u128, wrapping to small values and enabling theft via undervalued positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Liquidity Removal Underflow Risk] If remove_liquidity decrements Position.liquidity without checked subtraction, could removing more than available liquidity underflow to near-u128::MAX, massively inflating position value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Owed Coin Addition Overflow Risk] If fee collection adds to owed_coin_x/y without checking u64::MAX, could owed amounts overflow and wrap to zero, losing accumulated fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Owed Coin Withdrawal Underflow Risk] If collecting fees subtracts from owed_coin_x/y without sufficient balance checks, could underflow enable collecting more fees than owed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: PositionRewardInfo] [Reward Overflow Risk] If coins_owed_reward increments without checked addition, could reward amounts overflow u64, wrapping to zero and losing user rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: momentum_adaptor] [Price Slippage Risk] Since position value depends on tick_lower/upper_index, if these can be manipulated to create positions at extreme prices, could attackers exploit vault's DEX slippage tolerance to inflate position value beyond oracle price? (High)"
