  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Protocol Attack] Can an attacker compromise queue authority to affect multiple protocols (Volo Vault, Navi, Suilend, Cetus) simultaneously if they all rely on this oracle queue? Precondition: Queue is widely used. Violated invariant: Single point of failure should not exist. Impact: Multi-protocol systemic risk. (Critical)",

Precondition: Test coverage gaps.
