  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/bit_math.move] [Function: least_significant_bit()] [Denial of Service] Any caller invoking least_significant_bit() will encounter an abort 0, causing transaction failure. If Volo Vault or MMT v3 AMM operations depend on this function for tick math, position management, or liquidity calculations, all such operations will fail. What is the impact on vault operations and user funds when this function is called? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/bit_math.move] [Function: most_significant_bit()] [Denial of Service] Any caller invoking most_significant_bit() will encounter an abort 0, causing transaction failure. If this function is required for price range calculations, sqrt price computations, or tick bitmap operations in CLMM adaptors, all dependent vault operations will be blocked. What is the complete dependency chain and impact? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/bit_math.move] [Module: mmt_v3::bit_math] [Missing Implementation] Both public functions are unimplemented stubs. If any production code in Volo Vault, Cetus adaptor, or MMT v3 integration attempts to call these functions, the transaction will abort. Has the dependency analysis verified that no production code paths invoke these functions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/bit_math.move] [Function: least_significant_bit()] [Input Validation] The function accepts u256 value but provides no actual computation. If implemented in future, could the function handle edge cases like value=0, value=1, or value=MAX_U256 correctly? What are the expected mathematical properties and error handling requirements? (Medium)",
