  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Address Conversion] Does address::from_u256(0) reliably produce the zero address, or can implementation differences cause incorrect status assignment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: new_vault_receipt_info()] [Table Ownership] Are the Tables passed to new_vault_receipt_info() properly owned and validated, or can shared/borrowed tables cause concurrent modification issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Maximum u64] If pending_deposit_balance is at u64::MAX and update_after_execute_deposit() is called with executed_deposit_balance > 0, can this cause issues with subsequent deposit requests? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Maximum u256] If shares is at u256::MAX, can update_after_execute_withdraw() properly decrease it, or do edge cases near maximum values cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Zero Shares Edge Case] When self.shares = 0, update_reward() calculates acc_reward as 0 even if reward index increases—can this cause first depositors to lose accumulated global rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Claim All Principal] If amount equals claimable_principal exactly, does the subtraction leave claimable_principal at 0 properly, or can precision issues leave dust amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Maximum Pending Shares] Can pending_withdraw_shares reach u256::MAX through repeated requests, and does this block further withdrawal requests? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_execute_deposit() & update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Share Balance] Can shares become negative (underflow to large u256) through a sequence of deposits and withdrawals, breaking accounting invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Pending vs Total Shares] Can pending_withdraw_shares exceed shares, and if so, does update_after_execute_withdraw() handle this edge case properly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Pending Deposit Underflow] If multiple concurrent executions try to decrease pending_deposit_balance, can race conditions cause underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Total Accounting] Does the sum (shares + pending_deposit_balance - pending_withdraw_shares + claimable_principal) represent total user entitlement, and can this be manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the oracle price used in vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() to inflate their acc_reward calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Stale Oracle Price] If vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() uses a stale oracle price, can rewards be calculated incorrectly, benefiting or harming users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Price Decimal Mismatch] If reward index uses different decimals than expected by vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price(), can this cause orders-of-magnitude errors in reward calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Timestamp Overflow] Can last_deposit_time overflow if set to u64::MAX or near it, causing comparisons with current time to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Timestamp Regression] Can last_deposit_time be set to a value in the past, allowing users to bypass time-based locking windows immediately? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: last_deposit_time()] [Time-Based Attacks] Can an attacker repeatedly deposit and cancel to update last_deposit_time without actual fund commitment, manipulating time-locked operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: Multiple] [Sandwich Attack] Can an attacker front-run a large deposit execution with their own deposit request, then back-run with withdrawal to profit from share price changes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: Multiple] [Griefing Attack] Can an attacker spam tiny deposit/withdraw requests to bloat storage and make legitimate operations gas-inefficient? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_execute_deposit() & update_reward()] [Reward Dilution Attack] Can an attacker deposit large amounts just before reward distribution, then immediately request withdrawal to dilute rewards for long-term stakers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_request_deposit() & update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Request Spam] Can an attacker repeatedly request and cancel deposits to manipulate status transitions and potentially bypass operational locks? (Medium)"
