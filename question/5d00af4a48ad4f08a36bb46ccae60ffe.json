  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call validate() with a malicious aggregator object that returns true for has_authority() without actually owning it, bypassing authority checks before deletion? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] If has_authority() checks ctx.sender() against aggregator.authority, can an attacker manipulate the TxContext or spoof the sender to pass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Access Control] Does run() being a public entry function allow any external caller to attempt deletion if they can obtain an Aggregator object reference, enabling unauthorized deletion attempts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Check] Can the authority field of an aggregator be modified after creation but before deletion, allowing a former authority to delete an aggregator they no longer control? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization] If aggregator.authority is set to a multisig or contract address, can any member bypass consensus and unilaterally call run() to delete the aggregator? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Bypass] Since EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION is hardcoded to 1, can an attacker create a version 0 or version 2+ aggregator that bypasses deletion restrictions or security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] If aggregator.version() returns a different value than EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION, the deletion fails - can this be exploited to create un-deletable aggregators that cause resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Validation] Does the version check at line 18 protect against future aggregator versions being deleted by old action modules, potentially leaving state inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Upgrade Path] If VERSION in aggregator.move is updated to 2 but EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION remains 1, will all newer aggregators become un-deletable, causing permanent resource locks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Object Deletion] Does aggregator.delete() at line 26 properly clean up all nested resources (UpdateState, CurrentResult) or can dangling references cause memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Ownership Transfer] Since run() takes aggregator by value, can an attacker front-run a legitimate deletion by transferring ownership of the aggregator object just before the transaction executes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Resource Cleanup] If the aggregator object contains a UID with dynamic fields or child objects, does delete() at line 26 cascade deletion or leave orphaned objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Object Consumption] After validate() passes with a reference, can the aggregator object be modified or transferred before actuate() consumes it, violating validation assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Shared Object] If aggregator is a shared object, can multiple concurrent deletion attempts race, causing double-deletion or event emission without actual deletion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] Event emission at line 27 occurs AFTER aggregator.delete() at line 26 - if delete() fails silently, can the AggregatorDeleted event be emitted without actual deletion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission] Can an attacker call actuate() multiple times with the same aggregator_id to emit duplicate AggregatorDeleted events, confusing off-chain indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data] The AggregatorDeleted event at lines 23-25 only stores aggregator_id - should it also store authority, timestamp, or deletion reason for audit trail completeness? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] Since event::emit() is called after delete(), can external listeners observe stale aggregator state if they query by ID before event processing completes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy] Between validate() and actuate() calls, can a malicious aggregator implementation trigger callbacks that modify state or perform recursive deletions? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Race Condition] If multiple transactions call run() concurrently for the same aggregator, can the first deletion succeed while later ones fail with cryptic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [State Mutation] Can has_authority() or version() checks at lines 18-19 have side effects that modify aggregator state, causing inconsistent validation results? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [External Dependency] Does aggregator.delete() from the aggregator module properly handle deletion of aggregators that are referenced by other contracts (queues, oracles, vaults)? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Integrity] Can an aggregator be deleted while price updates are in flight, causing the vault's assets_value_updated timestamp to become stale and violate loss_tolerance checks? (High)"
