  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_user_balance()] [Storage Module Reentrancy] If storage module allows reentrancy and get_user_balance() triggers interest accrual with callbacks, could attacker reenter through this getter to manipulate state mid-query? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_reserves_count()] [Dynamic Reserve Addition] If reserves can be added/removed while get_reserve_data() executes, could iterator skip new reserves or access deleted ones causing incomplete data or panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_current_rate()] [Rate Staleness] If storage doesn't auto-update rates before returning them, could callers get outdated rates that don't reflect current utilization, enabling rate arbitrage strategies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_index()] [Index Update Timing] If indices are updated asynchronously and getter returns stale values, could there be temporal window where user balances don't reflect accrued interest, allowing interest-free borrowing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_total_supply()] [Supply Accounting] If total_supply includes pending deposits not yet processed, could double-counting occur when users query state and simultaneously process deposits in same transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: storage::get_liquidation_factors()] [Factor Update Race] If liquidation factors can be updated by governance while getter executes, could returned values be inconsistent (old ratio with new bonus) breaking liquidation math? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: Multiple Storage Calls] [Consistency Guarantee] Function makes 15+ separate storage calls for reserve data - are these atomic? Could storage state change between calls returning inconsistent reserve snapshot? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: Clock Parameter] [Clock Validation] Functions accept Clock reference but don't validate it - could malicious contracts pass fake Clock objects with manipulated timestamps to get incorrect oracle prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Integration: PriceOracle Parameter] [Oracle Validation] get_oracle_info() accepts PriceOracle reference without validation - could attackers pass malicious oracle objects returning fake prices to poison off-chain systems? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Price Oracle] If Volo Vault uses get_oracle_info() for adaptor pricing and valid flag is ignored, could vault proceed with operations using invalid prices leading to catastrophic losses in Navi/Suilend/Cetus positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: User Balance] If vault adaptors query user state to check borrow capacity and indices are stale, could vault over-leverage Navi positions exceeding health factor limits causing unexpected liquidations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Reserve Data] If vault uses get_reserve_data() to determine deposit caps but data is stale, could vault attempt deposits exceeding actual caps causing transaction failures and DoS during operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: LTV Values] If vault calculates maximum borrowing using LTV from getter but actual storage has different values, could health limiter checks fail causing vault operations to revert or violate safety invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Interest Rates] If vault projects APY using rates from getter but rates change before operation execution, could vault lock funds at worse rates than expected violating loss tolerance parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Oracle Decimals] If vault assumes fixed decimals (e.g., 1e9) but oracle returns different decimals per asset, could vault USD value calculations be off by orders of magnitude causing incorrect share minting/burning? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Treasury Balance] If vault tracks protocol revenue using treasury_balance but this includes pending not-yet-withdrawn fees, could vault double-count revenue in total value calculations inflating share prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Liquidation Threshold] If vault health limiter uses liquidation_threshold from getter for Navi positions but Navi has updated thresholds, could mismatch cause vault to exceed safe leverage ratios? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Borrow Index] If vault calculates debt amounts using borrow_index but doesn't account for index growth during multi-step operations, could vault underestimate debt and violate health factor requirements? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Vault Integration: Reserve Count] If vault iterates reserves using get_reserves_count() but count changes mid-operation due to new reserve additions, could vault miss processing some reserves in rebalancing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: Empty Protocol] If protocol has zero reserves configured, all getter functions return empty vectors - could vault operations panic or proceed with invalid assumptions when no reserve data is available? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: Maximum Reserves] If protocol has 255 reserves (u8 max), could asset_id arithmetic wrap to 0 causing ID collision or infinite loop when processing reserve 255? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: Zero Oracle Price] If oracle returns price=0 for an asset (delisted or broken feed), could vault value calculations divide by zero or treat asset as worthless enabling theft of collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: MAX_U256 Values] If any storage getter returns u256::MAX (indicating error or uninitialized state), could arithmetic operations overflow immediately or cause all subsequent calculations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: User With No Positions] If get_user_state() is called for address with no positions, still returns entries with zero balances - could this cause off-chain systems to misinterpret user as having stale positions rather than no positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Edge Case: Newly Added Reserve] If reserve is added but not fully initialized, could get_reserve_data() return partially valid data with zero/default values causing vault to attempt operations on unusable reserve?
