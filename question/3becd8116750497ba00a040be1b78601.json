(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Module Import decimal] Aggregator relies on switchboard::decimal module - if decimal::new(), decimal::zero(), decimal::lt(), decimal::sub() have vulnerabilities, does aggregator inherit them? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: compute_current_result()] [Decimal Comparison] At line 389, decimal::min() and decimal::max() are used - if these don't handle negative decimals correctly, can min/max be reversed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: median_result()] [Decimal lt() Method] At line 531, update.result.lt() is called - if lt() has precision errors or negative number bugs, can it produce incorrect partition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: add_result()] [Timestamp Future Attack] At line 246, timestamp_ms parameter can be future timestamp - can attacker submit updates with timestamp far in future, making all other updates appear stale?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: compute_current_result()] [Timestamp Comparison] At lines 391-392, min and max timestamps are computed but not validated against now_ms - can timestamp be from far future causing incorrect staleness perception? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: add_result()] [Clock Manipulation] add_result() depends on Clock object at line 248 - if Clock can be manipulated or is from test context, can attacker bypass staleness checks? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Struct Aggregator] Aggregator is shared object (line 218) allowing concurrent access - are all mutations properly synchronized or can race conditions corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: add_result()] [Option Extract Panic] At line 254, option.extract() is called after is_some() check - but between check and extract, can concurrent transaction invalidate option causing panic?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: set_authority()] [Unauthorized Transfer] set_authority() at lines 223-225 has no event emission - can authority be silently transferred without off-chain monitoring detecting it? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Immediate Effect] Config changes take effect immediately without delay - can attacker time config change right before add_result() to manipulate acceptance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/aggregator.move] [Function: set_configs()] [No Bounds Validation] set_configs() accepts any u64/u32 values without validation - can max_staleness_seconds be set to 1ms causing all updates to be stale? (High)",
