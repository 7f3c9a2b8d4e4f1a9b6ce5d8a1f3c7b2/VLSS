  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Denial of Service] The fee() function unconditionally aborts with code 0 - does this cause all calls to this function to fail, potentially blocking critical fee collection operations in the Volo Vault when integrated with Cetus CLMM positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Denial of Service] The reward() function unconditionally aborts with code 0 - does this prevent reward collection from MMT v3 pools, potentially causing reward tokens to accumulate unclaimed and creating accounting discrepancies in vault total value calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Implementation Risk] When the stub implementation is replaced with actual logic, could missing validation on the Position object allow an attacker to collect fees from a position they don't own? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Implementation Risk] When implemented, could the fee collection logic fail to check if the position is still valid or has been closed, allowing double collection of fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Implementation Risk] When implemented, could the reward collection logic fail to validate the reward coin type R matches the pool's configured reward types, allowing type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Struct: FeeCollectedEvent] [Information Leakage] The FeeCollectedEvent exposes position_id and exact fee amounts - could this information be used by MEV bots to front-run fee collection transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Struct: CollectPoolRewardEvent] [Information Leakage] The CollectPoolRewardEvent exposes position_id and reward amounts - could this leak sensitive vault strategy information to competitors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Struct: FeeCollectedEvent] [Missing Field] The FeeCollectedEvent doesn't include a timestamp field - could this make it difficult to correlate fee collection with specific epoch rollovers or vault operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Struct: CollectPoolRewardEvent] [Missing Field] The CollectPoolRewardEvent doesn't include reward type metadata beyond TypeName - could this cause issues tracking multiple reward streams from the same pool? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Access Control] The fee() function is public and takes mutable references to Pool and Position - when implemented, could lack of capability checks allow unauthorized fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Access Control] The reward() function is public and takes mutable references - when implemented, could missing ownership validation allow anyone to collect rewards from any position? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Parameter Validation] The fee() function accepts Pool<X, Y> and Position parameters - when implemented, could it fail to verify that the Position actually belongs to this specific Pool, allowing cross-pool fee theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Parameter Validation] The reward() function accepts generic type R - when implemented, could incorrect type parameter usage allow collection of wrong reward tokens or cause type safety violations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Clock Dependency] The fee() function requires Clock parameter - when implemented, could manipulation of clock readings affect fee calculation accuracy or allow temporal attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Clock Dependency] The reward() function requires Clock parameter - when implemented, could clock-based reward accrual calculations be exploited through timestamp manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Version Dependency] The fee() function requires Version parameter - when implemented, could version mismatch between this module and the pool module cause compatibility issues or bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Version Dependency] The reward() function requires Version parameter - when implemented, could version validation be missing, allowing operation with incompatible pool versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Return Value] The fee() function returns (Coin<X>, Coin<Y>) - when implemented, could zero-value coins be returned without proper checks, causing issues in vault accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Return Value] The reward() function returns Coin<R> - when implemented, could zero-value reward coins be returned, causing vault reward tracking to become desynchronized? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Return Value] When implemented, could the fee collection return more coins than actually accrued, leading to pool insolvency? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Return Value] When implemented, could the reward collection fail to update position state, allowing repeated reward claims? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Module: collect] [Integration Risk] Since this module is a local dependency for volo-vault, does the stub implementation cause vault operations that depend on MMT v3 fee/reward collection to fail catastrophically? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Module: collect] [Integration Risk] Could the vault's Cetus CLMM adaptor call these stub functions, causing all Cetus position management operations to abort and lock funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Module: collect] [Upgrade Risk] When this stub is replaced with actual implementation, could the upgrade process fail to maintain backward compatibility with existing vault positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Module: collect] [Upgrade Risk] Is there a migration path to replace this stub without requiring vault operations to pause or positions to be closed? (High)"
