  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Reward Buffer Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate reward_manager or vault state between `update_reward_buffers()` and `execute_deposit()` to claim extra rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Receipt Mismatch] If deposit_request.receipt_id() doesn't match the actual receipt in reward_manager, can update_receipt_reward() update wrong receipt or fail silently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Max Shares Slippage Bypass] Can an attacker execute deposits with max_shares_received=0 or very high value to accept any number of shares, including unfavorable rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Request ID Collision] Can an attacker reuse or forge request_id to execute deposits for requests they don't own, stealing shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] Can stale or manipulated oracle data in config cause incorrect share minting during deposit execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Frozen Operator Bypass] If operator freeze status changes between batch deposits, can a frozen operator complete some deposits before being blocked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Array Index Out of Bounds] If request_ids and max_shares_received vectors have different lengths, can the index lookup (line 430) cause out-of-bounds access or use wrong slippage values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Reward Update Once Attack] Since update_reward_buffers() is called once for all deposits, can early deposits in the batch get unfair reward allocation compared to later ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Request ID Reuse in Batch] Can the same request_id appear multiple times in the vector, causing double-execution and share inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Index_of Failure] If request_id is not found in the vector, does index_of() panic or return invalid index, causing wrong max_shares_received usage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Partial Execution Atomicity] If one deposit in the batch fails, do all previous successful deposits get reverted, or can partial execution occur leaving inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Gas Limit DoS] Can an attacker create a batch with hundreds of deposits causing out-of-gas failure, preventing legitimate deposits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Recipient Mismatch] Can an operator specify a different recipient address than the deposit owner, redirecting cancelled funds to attacker? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Receipt ID Verification] If receipt_id doesn't match the deposit request's receipt, can cancel_deposit() still succeed allowing cancellation of wrong requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Time Lock Bypass] Can operators cancel deposits during locking windows when users shouldn't be able to cancel, violating locking invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Clock Manipulation] Can passing manipulated clock parameter allow cancellation outside allowed time windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Transfer to Zero Address] Can recipient be address(0) causing funds to be burned instead of returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Zero Address Recipient] If recipient is address::from_u256(0), funds go to claimable_principal. Can this be abused to lock funds or create accounting issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Max Amount Slippage Attack] Can users set max_amount_received to very high values accepting unfavorable withdrawal rates due to oracle manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Reward Update Race] Can attacker manipulate vault state between update_reward_buffers() and execute_withdraw() to claim unearned rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Receipt Reward Mismatch] If withdraw_request.receipt_id() is stale or manipulated, can update_receipt_reward() update wrong receipts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Recipient Address Spoofing] Can operator change recipient address during execution to redirect withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Claimable Principal Overflow] If many withdrawals go to claimable_principal, can repeated add_claimable_principal() calls cause overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_withdraw()] [Vector Length Mismatch] If request_ids and max_amount_received have different lengths, can index lookup (line 505) cause incorrect slippage values or panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_withdraw()] [Duplicate Request IDs] Can the same request_id appear multiple times causing double-withdrawal and vault principal drain? (Critical)"
