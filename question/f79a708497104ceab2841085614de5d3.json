  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Duration Underflow] Can max_duration_within_thresholds be set to 1ms or extremely small value causing diff_threshold2_timer logic to trigger immediately, disabling threshold protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_max_timestamp_diff_to_price_feed()] [Staleness Bypass] Can an attacker call set_max_timestamp_diff_to_price_feed() with value=type(u64).max to accept infinitely stale prices, allowing exploitation of outdated price data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_max_timestamp_diff_to_price_feed()] [Zero Timestamp] Can setting max_timestamp_diff=0 cause all price feeds to be immediately considered stale, denying service to all oracle consumers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_max_timestamp_diff_to_price_feed()] [Race Condition] Can max_timestamp_diff be changed while price validation is occurring, causing some prices to pass staleness checks that should have failed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed()] [History Invalidation] Can set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed() be called with value=0 to immediately invalidate all historical prices, breaking vault operations that compare current vs historical prices?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold2_to_price_feed()] [Invariant Violation] Does config::set_price_diff_threshold2_to_price_feed() properly validate that threshold2 >= threshold1, or can threshold2 be set lower creating logic errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed()] [Order Dependency] Can threshold1 and threshold2 be updated in wrong order (threshold1 increased above threshold2) between transactions, temporarily violating the invariant and allowing bad prices?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_max_duration_within_thresholds_to_price_feed()] [Timer Bypass] Can max_duration_within_thresholds be set to 0, causing diff_threshold2_timer to immediately expire and disabling extended threshold protection?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Price Cap Removal] Can maximum_effective_price be set to type(u256).max to effectively remove the upper price bound, allowing arbitrarily high prices that could inflate vault valuations?
