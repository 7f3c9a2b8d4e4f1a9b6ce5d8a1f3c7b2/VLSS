  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Re-enablement] Can enable_oracle() be called on an already-enabled Oracle to change its parameters? Should there be a disable_oracle() function to prevent re-enablement without proper authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Queue Verification] Does new() verify that the queue ID exists and is a valid Queue object? Can oracles be created with fake queue IDs that point to non-existent or malicious queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_key()] [Key Binding] Is oracle_key cryptographically bound to the Oracle's ID or other fields? Can attackers reuse oracle_key values across multiple Oracle objects, causing key confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Expired Attestation Accumulation] If add_attestation() is never called after initial attestations are added, expired attestations remain in valid_attestations forever. Can this cause stale data to persist indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Cleanup Frequency] The filter only runs when add_attestation() is called. If attestations expire between calls, can valid_attestation_count() return inflated counts that include expired attestations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: valid_attestation_count()] [Expired Count Inclusion] Does valid_attestation_count() filter by timestamp to exclude expired attestations, or does it count all attestations in the vector? If the latter, can it return counts for expired attestations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Timestamp Parameter Trust] Who provides the timestamp_ms parameter to add_attestation()? If it's the caller, can they manipulate it to keep their attestations alive longer or expire others prematurely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Queue ID Immutability] Once an Oracle is created with a specific queue ID, can it ever be moved to a different queue? If not, can this cause issues if the original queue is decommissioned? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: queue_key()] [Queue Key Mismatch] If oracle.queue_key doesn't match the actual queue's key, can this cause oracle routing failures or allow oracles to bypass queue-level access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Queue Type Safety] Is the queue parameter validated to be an actual Queue object type, or can arbitrary IDs be passed, causing type mismatches later? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [MR Enclave Format] The mr_enclave vector is stored but never validated. Can attackers pass arbitrary byte sequences as mr_enclave, bypassing secure enclave verification? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Oracle] [MR Enclave Usage] The mr_enclave field is stored in Oracle but has no accessor function. How do consumers verify enclave integrity if they can't read mr_enclave? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Enclave Revocation] If a secure enclave is compromised and its MR enclave should be revoked, can enable_oracle() update the mr_enclave to a new value without invalidating existing attestations from the old enclave? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: expiration_time_ms()] [Expiration Check] The expiration_time_ms accessor returns the value but doesn't check if current time > expiration_time_ms. Can consumers forget to check expiration and use expired oracles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Permanent Expiration] Can enable_oracle() set expiration_time_ms to a past timestamp, causing the oracle to be permanently expired? Is there validation to prevent this? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Expiration Extension] If an oracle is about to expire, can enable_oracle() extend the expiration indefinitely, allowing compromised oracles to remain active? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Drop Ability Security] Attestation has 'drop' ability, meaning it can be silently discarded. Can this lead to attestations being accidentally or maliciously dropped without proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Store Ability Security] Attestation has 'store' ability, allowing it to be stored in other structs. Can attestations be moved to unauthorized containers, bypassing oracle-level access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Copy Semantics] Since Attestation has 'copy', any code can duplicate attestations. Can this lead to attestation reuse across different oracles or replay attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: secp256k1_key()] [Vector Copy Cost] The secp256k1_key accessor copies the entire vector (33-65 bytes). Can frequent calls to this function in hot paths cause performance issues or excessive gas costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_key()] [Key Exposure] The oracle_key is publicly readable. Can this leak sensitive information about oracle configuration or allow attackers to enumerate all oracle keys? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: id()] [Object ID Exposure] The id() function exposes the Oracle's internal UID. Can this be used to target specific oracles for attacks or cause privacy leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Module: switchboard::oracle] [Package Boundary] All mutable functions are public(package). Can a malicious module added to the switchboard package bypass all security controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Creator Identity] Does new() record who created the Oracle? Without this, can anyone in the package create oracles and claim ownership? (Medium)"
