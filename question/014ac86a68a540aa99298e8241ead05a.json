  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_borrow_rate()] [Below Optimal Branch] At line 348, when utilization < optimal, jump rate is not applied - is this correct or should there be a transition region? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_borrow_rate()] [Zero Utilization] If utilization is 0, the rate is just base_rate - can this be exploited to get very cheap borrows by manipulating utilization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_borrow_rate()] [Parameter Validation] Are base_rate, multiplier, jump_rate_multiplier validated to be within reasonable ranges, or can malicious storage values cause rate calculation to break? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Reserve Factor Overflow] At line 368, (ray_math::ray() - reserve_factor) - can reserve_factor be >= ray() causing underflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Utilization Recalculation] Utilization is calculated again at line 364 - if it differs from the one used in borrow rate calculation due to storage changes, can rates be inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Triple Ray Mul] At lines 366-369, there are nested ray_mul operations - can precision loss compound to give significantly wrong supply rate? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Borrow Rate Input] The function takes borrow_rate as parameter (line 358) but then recalculates utilization independently - should it use the same utilization as borrow rate calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Reserve Factor Edge Case] If reserve_factor is set to ray() (100%), line 368 becomes ray() - ray() = 0, making supply rate 0 - is this intended behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Zero Utilization] If utilization is 0, supply rate becomes 0 - can suppliers be hurt by attackers manipulating utilization to zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Rate Consistency] Should supply rate be calculated as (borrow_rate * utilization * (1 - reserve_factor)) or are there rounding issues in the order of operations? (Medium)"
