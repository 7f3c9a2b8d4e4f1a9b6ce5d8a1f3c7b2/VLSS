  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Ownership Ambiguity] If the Queue object used by Volo Vault for price feeds is shared or has weak access control, could attackers add malicious oracles to the legitimate queue? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch with Vault] If Volo Vault expects Queue version 1 but run() could work with other versions (if validation is bypassed), could this cause compatibility issues or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Lifecycle Management] The module only handles oracle creation, not deletion or updates - could this lead to oracle key squatting where malicious actors register keys that are needed later? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Duplicate Prevention Logic] The only duplicate check is existing_oracles_contains() - if this check has edge cases (empty key, very long key, special characters), could duplicates be created? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle-Queue Binding] The oracle is bound to queue.id() and queue.queue_key() - if queue identity can change or be spoofed, could oracles end up bound to wrong queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle ID Predictability] If oracle::new() generates IDs using predictable algorithms (sequential, timestamp-based), could attackers predict future oracle IDs for front-running or exploit planning? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Key Entropy] If oracle_key generation is weak (low entropy, predictable patterns), could attackers brute-force or predict keys to pre-register important oracles? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Reentrancy via Event] If event::emit() can trigger callbacks to attacker contracts, could reentrancy occur between oracle creation and queue update? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Callback in oracle::new()] If oracle::new() calls back to attacker code (e.g., through witness pattern or custom init), could state be corrupted before queue.add_existing_oracle() executes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Hard Fork Risk] If Switchboard protocol forks and multiple Queue implementations exist, could oracle_init_action be used on wrong queues causing cross-version confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Upgrade Safety] If this module is upgraded, how are existing oracles handled? Could upgrade cause loss of oracle registry or break oracle-queue bindings? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Squatting] Since run() is permissionless and free (except gas), could attackers register all valuable oracle_keys cheaply to extort legitimate users or DoS the system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Price Manipulation] Could an attacker manipulate gas prices to make oracle creation very expensive, effectively DoSing new oracle registration during high-gas periods? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle-Key Mismatch] After oracle::new() creates an oracle, that oracle should be indexed by oracle_key in the queue - if there's a mismatch, could lookups fail or return wrong oracles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue ID Consistency] The oracle is created with queue.id() but the event emits queue.id() separately - could these IDs differ if Queue has shared/dynamic IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Switchboard Protocol Assumptions] This is Switchboard on-demand oracle initialization - could missing Switchboard-specific validations (attestations, signatures, etc.) allow creation of invalid oracles? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Input Sanitization] The oracle_key is not sanitized for SQL injection, XSS, or other injection attacks - could malicious keys cause issues in off-chain systems parsing events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Length Limits] There are no maximum length checks on oracle_key - could extremely long keys cause buffer overflows in C/C++ bridge code or off-chain processors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Return Value Check] Neither oracle::new() nor queue.add_existing_oracle() have explicit success checks - could silent failures go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Empty Oracle Key] What happens if oracle_key is an empty vector []? Will validate() pass and actuate() create an oracle with empty key? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Version Zero] If queue.version() is 0 (uninitialized), should this be accepted or rejected? Current check only rejects non-1 values. (Low)",
