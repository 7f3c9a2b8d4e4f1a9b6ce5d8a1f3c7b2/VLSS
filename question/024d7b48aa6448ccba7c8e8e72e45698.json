  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Atomic Operation] Are the split at line 17, destroy at line 19, and transfer at line 24 atomic? If not, could a crash or abort between steps leave coins in limbo? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Liquid Staking Integration] If split_coin is used to split LST tokens during stake/unstake, and the remainder goes to the wrong recipient due to ctx.sender confusion, could this drain user LST holdings? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Validator Pool Corruption] If split_coin_to_balance is used to handle validator delegation amounts, and the balance is inflated, could this allow delegating more SUI than available, breaking validator weight calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Fee Config Bypass] If Volo's fee_config expects fees to be deducted during coin splits, but split_coin doesn't call fee collection logic, could all splits bypass fees and cause revenue loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Boosted Balance Exploit] If split_coin_to_balance is used to credit boosted balances in liquid staking, and the balance value is manipulated, could users receive inflated rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Pause Enforcement] Neither function checks a pause flag - if Volo Vault is paused but split_coin still executes, could this allow operations during emergency states? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Operator Cap Requirement] Should split_coin require an OperatorCap for vault operations? If not, could unauthorized users split vault-held coins? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Vault Receipt Matching] If split_coin_to_balance is used in vault deposit flows, is there verification that the balance matches an expected receipt amount, or could mismatches enable theft? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Request Buffer Bypass] Could split_coin be used to bypass vault request buffers by directly splitting coins outside the normal deposit/withdraw request flow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Locking Window Violation] If split_coin_to_balance is called during a vault locking window, does it bypass the lock and allow premature withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Input Validation] Beyond amount > 0, are there other input validations missing (e.g., amount <= max_allowed_split) that could enable economic attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Return Value Validation] The function returns split_ without validating its value matches amount - could a buggy coin::split implementation return incorrect amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Intermediate State Safety] Between line 30 (split return) and line 33 (balance conversion), is the split coin protected from external manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Error Recovery] If any step fails, is there a rollback mechanism, or could partial execution leave coins in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Module: utils] [Least Privilege] Should these functions be entry functions to prevent direct external calls, limiting them to internal protocol use only? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Coin Type Verification] Is there runtime verification that CoinType matches expected vault asset types, preventing splits of malicious custom coin types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Balance Type Safety] Could type confusion allow Balance<CoinTypeA> to be treated as Balance<CoinTypeB> in downstream vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Transfer Recipient Validation] Should line 24's transfer::public_transfer validate that sender is an EOA and not a contract, preventing contract-controlled remainder hijacking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Multiple Return Paths] The function has two return paths (lines 20 and 25) - could inconsistent state between paths create vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Single Use Guarantee] Is there a mechanism preventing split_coin_to_balance from being called multiple times on the same coin within a transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Switchboard Oracle Dependency] If split amounts are based on oracle prices from Switchboard, could stale or manipulated prices cause incorrect splits that benefit attackers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Navi Health Factor] If the balance is used as collateral in Navi lending, does the conversion affect health factor calculations, potentially triggering liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Cetus CLMM Position] If split_coin is used to handle Cetus CLMM position tokens, could splitting violate position integrity or LP token accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance] [Suilend Obligation] If the balance is used in Suilend obligations, could the conversion bypass obligation checks and enable over-borrowing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin] [Momentum Integration] If split_coin is used with Momentum position tokens, could splitting break position tracking or reward calculations? (Medium)"
