  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_loan_balance()] [Negative Balance] Since Move doesn't have negative numbers, if is_increase=false should make balance negative, the underflow panic is correct behavior - but should there be explicit validation before subtraction?
