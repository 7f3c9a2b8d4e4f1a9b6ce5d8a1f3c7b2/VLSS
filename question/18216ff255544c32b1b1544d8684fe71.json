  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Migration: Emergency Patches] If a critical vulnerability is discovered requiring immediate version bump, could the abort prevent emergency upgrade procedures from executing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Economic: Fee Changes] If fee structure changes are gated by version checks, could the abort prevent deploying new fee models, locking in economically unviable rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Economic: Reward Distribution] If boosted balance rewards depend on version-specific calculation logic, could the abort cause incorrect reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Economic: Loss Tolerance] If version affects loss tolerance calculations, could the abort allow operations that should be blocked by tolerance limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Timing: Epoch Rollover] If epoch rollover in liquid staking checks MMT version, could the abort prevent rewards distribution or validator weight updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Timing: Lock Windows] If withdrawal locking window enforcement depends on version checks, could the abort allow premature withdrawals or prevent valid ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Oracle: Price Decimals] If MMT version determines oracle price decimal handling (1e9 vs 1e18), could the abort cause decimal mismatches in vault USD value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Oracle: Staleness Checks] If version affects oracle staleness thresholds, could the abort allow stale prices to be used, violating vault safety invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Staking: Validator Weights] If validator weight updates check MMT version for compatibility with delegation logic, could the abort prevent rebalancing, leading to suboptimal staking distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Staking: Delegation Path] If stake delegation to specific validators verifies version compatibility, could the abort cause delegation failures, leaving SUI unstaked and unrewarded? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Math: Version-Dependent Algorithms] If different MMT versions use different AMM math algorithms, could lack of version checking cause wrong algorithms to be applied, breaking swap pricing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Math: Precision Handling] If version affects fixed-point math precision (e.g., different decimal places), could the abort allow mixing precision levels, causing rounding errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Security: Defense in Depth] If version checks are a defense layer against incompatible protocol interactions, could their complete absence reduce security to single points of failure? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Security: Fail-Safe Design] Abort-on-call could be interpreted as fail-safe (deny by default). But is denying ALL operations safer than allowing some? Could this overly restrictive approach be worse than selective checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Composability: External Callers] If external protocols or UIs call version functions to check Volo compatibility, could the abort prevent integration, limiting Volo's ecosystem reach? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Composability: Flash Loans] If flash loan operations check version for reentrancy protection patterns, could the abort prevent complex DeFi strategies involving Volo Vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Governance: Admin Actions] If admin cap functions verify protocol version before privileged operations, could the abort prevent admins from executing emergency actions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Governance: Operator Limits] If operator freeze map updates check version, could the abort prevent operators from freezing malicious actors during attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Receipt: Vault Receipt Alignment] If vault receipt creation verifies MMT version for receipt format compatibility, could the abort cause receipt/vault ID mismatches, breaking deposit tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Receipt: Reward Manager] If reward manager operations check version before distributing rewards, could the abort prevent users from claiming their earned rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: Zero Version] Could Version be created with major=0 and minor=0? Would this be valid or indicate uninitialized state? The code provides no validation. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: Version Equality] If two Version objects with identical major/minor values exist, how should comparison work? Without ID checking, could this cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: VersionCap Loss] If the single VersionCap is accidentally destroyed (sent to 0x0 or similar), could version management become permanently impossible? (Medium)"
