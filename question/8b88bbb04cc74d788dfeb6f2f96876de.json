  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Collateral Removal] Can an attacker pass the health check, then immediately remove collateral from Navi before the vault operation completes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Debt Manipulation] Can an attacker temporarily pay down debt to pass health check, then immediately re-borrow after the check completes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Testing Gap] No validation that health_factor calculation matches Navi's actual implementation. Can divergence between test mocks and production cause vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Oracle Testing] No tests for oracle manipulation scenarios. Can untested oracle edge cases lead to production vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Decimal Testing] No tests for decimal conversion edge cases (overflow, underflow, precision loss). Can production encounter untested decimal scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Module] [Upgrade Risk] If lending_core module is upgraded with different health factor calculation logic, this adaptor may become incompatible. Can upgrade mismatches cause silent failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Constants] [Migration Risk] If Navi changes their health factor decimal base from E27 to another value, DECIMAL_E18 division would be incorrect. Can protocol changes break this adaptor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Version Lock] No version checking of lending_core or oracle modules. Can incompatible versions be used together, causing incorrect health calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Capital Inefficiency] If min_health_factor is set conservatively high, can this force vault operations to maintain excessive collateral, reducing yields? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Opportunity Cost] Can repeated health checks during high volatility prevent profitable vault rebalancing, causing opportunity costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Risk Concentration] The function checks one account's health. Can systemic risk from multiple accounts passing individual checks but failing collectively go undetected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Decimal Edge: 999999999999999999] If health_factor is 999999999999999999 (just under 1e18), hf_normalized becomes 0. Can positions with HF < 1.0 all map to error code 0? (Medium)"
