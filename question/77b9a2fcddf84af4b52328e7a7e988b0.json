  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Import Amount Zero] If import_amount=0 at line 166, the function still unpauses/rebalances/re-pauses the pool unnecessarily - is this gas-efficient? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Min Ratio Zero] If min_ratio=0 at line 166, the ratio check at line 179 provides no slippage protection - should there be a minimum threshold? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Fee Amount Zero] If collected_rewards is zero, fee_amount=0 at line 145 - splitting zero from balance and transferring zero coin wastes gas. Should this be checked? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: destroy_migration_cap()] [Target Count Zero] If target_exported_count=0 at line 191, and no exports happened, the cap can be destroyed immediately - is this intended? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: deposit_sui()] [Amount Zero] deposit_sui allows amount=0 at line 207 - splitting zero and emitting event wastes gas without state change. (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Empty Validator Set] If native_pool has no validators, export_stakes_from_v1 returns zero balance - does this break subsequent migration steps expecting non-zero balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Pending Balance Zero] If pending balance is zero at line 122, withdraw_all() returns zero - is joining zero balance to migration_storage safe? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Counter Overflow] exported_count is incremented at line 117 with addition - if migration requires millions of iterations, could exported_count overflow u64? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Balance Overflow] sui_balance.join() operations at lines 116 and 123 accumulate balances - could joining very large export amounts overflow the Balance<SUI> type? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Split Underflow] balance.split(fee_amount) at line 146 - if fee_amount > balance.value(), does this abort cleanly or leave storage corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Epoch Timing] ExportedEvent emits ctx.epoch() at line 131 - if migration spans multiple epochs due to max_iterations batching, events show inconsistent epochs. How is this reconciled? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Epoch Boundary] If import_stakes() is called during an epoch boundary, rebalance() might fail due to system state constraints - is this handled? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: test_init()] [Test Function Exposure] test_init() at lines 221-236 is marked #[test_only] but creates and transfers real objects - could test code be invoked in non-test contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: get_sui_balance_for_testing()] [Information Leak] Test functions at lines 239-246 expose internal state - if accidentally deployed to mainnet, could this aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Front-Running Import] An attacker observing import_stakes() in mempool could front-run with a large stake/unstake to manipulate the ratio before line 178's get_ratio() call. (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Fee Extraction Timing] If fees are taken before all exports complete, the fee calculation might be based on incomplete data - should fees only be taken after full export? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [MEV on Export] Large SUI withdrawals from export_stakes_from_v1 at line 113-114 could be front-run by validators to manipulate exchange rates. (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Shared Object Creation] MigrationStorage is created as public_share_object at line 89 - can multiple transactions access it concurrently causing race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Struct: MigrationStorage] [Concurrent Modification] MigrationStorage fields (sui_balance, exported_count) are modified across multiple functions - how is concurrent access synchronized? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [No Admin Check] create_stake_pool() only requires MigrationCap but doesn't verify caller owns it - could a compromised transaction obtain and misuse the cap? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Native Pool Access] export_stakes() requires mutable access to NativePool at line 107 - who controls this object and what prevents unauthorized calls? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Admin Cap Requirement] import_stakes() requires AdminCap at line 161 but also MigrationCap - are these owned by the same party? What if they diverge? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Collected Rewards Invariant] Line 74 assumes collected_rewards != 0 means no prior migration, but collected_rewards could be manually manipulated - is this invariant reliable? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: destroy_migration_cap()] [Exported Count Invariant] Line 193 checks exported_count == target_exported_count, but what if export_stakes() was called with varying max_iterations? Could count mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Fee Balance Invariant] After take_unclaimed_fees(), migration_storage should have exactly (exported_sui - fees) remaining, but this isn't explicitly verified. (Low)"
