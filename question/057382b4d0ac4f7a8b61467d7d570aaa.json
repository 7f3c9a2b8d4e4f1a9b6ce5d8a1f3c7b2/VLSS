  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Event: CreateFundsPool] [Force Parameter] Line 82 includes force parameter in event but force logic not implemented; could this confuse monitoring systems? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Event: IncreasedFunds] [Balance Exposure] Line 88 emits exact balance before/after; could this leak information for MEV arbitrage? (Low)",
