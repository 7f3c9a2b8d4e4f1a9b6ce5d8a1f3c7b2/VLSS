  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Underflow Protection] At line 78, the subtraction total_supply_usd_value - total_borrow_usd_value is protected by the check at line 74 - but can rounding errors cause the condition to pass while still causing underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Precision Loss] mul_with_oracle_price() at lines 65-66 divides by ORACLE_DECIMALS (1e18) - can this cause precision loss for small balances, incorrectly reporting 0 value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Rounding Error] When converting supply_scaled and borrow_scaled from u256 to u256 at lines 65-66, can casting cause truncation for very large ray_math values? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Off-by-One Error] The loop at line 43 starts with i = storage.get_reserves_count() and checks 'while (i > 0)' then uses 'i - 1' - could this skip reserve 0 or access invalid reserve i? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Loop Bounds] At line 37, get_reserves_count() returns the count - if this is 0, the loop never executes and returns 0 value even if positions exist - is this correct? (Medium)",
