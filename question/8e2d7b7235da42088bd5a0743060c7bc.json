(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Sequence Number Attack] Can replaying the same run() transaction with the same parameters but in different blocks create unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Staleness] How long is validation considered valid - can there be a gap where validation passes but conditions change before actuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Timing Window] In what time window is the event emitted relative to authority change - can listeners miss rapid changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Block Boundary] Can authority changes at block boundaries create inconsistent states for cross-block operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Code Collision] Can EInvalidAuthority or EInvalidAggregatorVersion error codes collide with other module error codes, causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Silent Failure] Do the assert! calls properly propagate errors up the call stack, or can they be caught and suppressed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Partial Execution] If event::emit() in actuate() throws an exception, does the set_authority() call get rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Error Codes] Should actuate() have its own error codes for invalid new_authority values (zero address, self-transfer, etc.)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Exception Propagation] Do exceptions from validate() or actuate() propagate correctly, or can they be swallowed by the public entry function? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Ping-Pong DoS] Can two colluding addresses continuously transfer authority back and forth to DoS the aggregator or its consumers?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Lock DoS] If aggregator version is upgraded but EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION isn't updated, does this permanently DoS all authority transfers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Event System DoS] Can excessive authority change events overwhelm the event emission system and prevent other critical events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Depletion DoS] Can crafted inputs cause run() to consume all available gas before completing, DoSing the transaction? (Low)",
