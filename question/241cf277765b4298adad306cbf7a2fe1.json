  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit a race condition where queue.has_authority(ctx) passes during validation but authority is revoked before actuate() executes, allowing unauthorized config changes through the split validate/actuate pattern? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] If queue.has_authority(ctx) only checks transaction sender but not the signer's role hierarchy, can a low-privilege operator escalate to set critical configs like fee_recipient by calling run() directly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Access Control] Does the authority check at line 34 verify against a multi-sig or single authority? If single authority is compromised, can attacker drain all oracle fees by setting fee to max u64 and fee_recipient to their address? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authorization Missing] Since run() is a public entry function callable by anyone who passes has_authority(), can an attacker front-run legitimate authority transactions to set malicious configs if they temporarily gain authority access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Delegation] If queue.has_authority() allows delegated authority holders, can a revoked delegate still execute config changes if their transaction was submitted before revocation but processed after? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Time-of-check Time-of-use] Between validate() checking has_authority() at line 34 and actuate() modifying state at line 47, if authority changes in Queue due to parallel transaction, does this create a TOCTOU vulnerability allowing unauthorized updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Revocation] If authority is revoked mid-transaction after validate() passes but before actuate() completes, will the config update still succeed, violating access control invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Multi-sig Bypass] If the Queue authority check doesn't enforce minimum signature thresholds, can a single compromised key from a 3-of-5 multi-sig update critical oracle parameters unilaterally? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] The version check at line 33 enforces EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION == 1, but if an upgraded Queue v2 exists with different config structure, can calling this action on v2 queues corrupt state or bypass new v2 validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade] If queue.version() can be manipulated or downgraded from v2 back to v1, can an attacker bypass stricter v2 validations by forcing execution through this v1 action module? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Hardcoded Version] Since EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1, when Queue upgrades to v2, will old transactions calling this action revert, causing DoS for legitimate config updates until this module is also upgraded? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Order] Version check happens before authority check; if an attacker crafts a v2 queue mimicking v1 structure, could they bypass version validation and exploit authority check differences between versions?
