  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Maximum Values] What happens if the Supra oracle returns price=u128::MAX, decimal=u16::MAX, timestamp=u128::MAX? Do downstream calculations handle these maximum values correctly without overflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Minimum Values] What happens if price=1 (minimum non-zero), decimal=1, target_decimal=18? Does the conversion produce price=1000000000000000000 correctly, or could there be underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Same Decimals] If source decimal equals target_decimal, does the conversion function short-circuit efficiently, or does it waste gas iterating through a no-op loop? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Extreme Decimal Difference] If decimal=1 and target_decimal=18 (difference of 17), the price gets multiplied by 10^17 - could this cause overflow for even moderate prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Pair ID Boundary] What happens with pair_id=0 or pair_id=u32::MAX? Are these valid pair IDs in Supra oracle, or would they return default/error values that appear valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Empty Vector] What happens if vector_to_pair_id() receives an empty vector? Does sui::address::from_bytes() handle this gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Edge Case: Oversized Vector] What happens if vector_to_pair_id() receives a vector longer than 32 bytes? Does the address conversion truncate or reject it? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Cross-Module: Vault Integration] When the vault calls oracle_pro which calls this adaptor, if any step in the chain returns incorrect prices, could the vault's total value calculation be wrong, enabling deposit/withdrawal arbitrage? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Cross-Module: Health Limiter] If the health limiter uses Supra prices to calculate health factors, could manipulated prices from this adaptor cause incorrect liquidation decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Cross-Module: LST Staking] If liquid staking uses Supra oracle for SUI price, could price manipulation enable attackers to mint excessive LST tokens during stake operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Cross-Module: Fee Calculation] If protocol fees are calculated based on USD values using Supra prices, could price manipulation cause fee under-collection or over-collection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Cross-Module: External Protocol Adaptors] If Navi, Suilend, Cetus, or Momentum adaptors use Supra prices for collateral valuation, could price attacks in this adaptor propagate to those protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Comparison: Pyth vs Supra] Does the Pyth adaptor have additional safety checks (like confidence intervals or price bounds) that Supra adaptor lacks, creating asymmetric risk between oracle providers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Comparison: Pyth vs Supra] The Pyth adaptor uses get_price_unsafe_to_target_decimal() - does the 'unsafe' naming indicate that Pyth has safety features that Supra doesn't, suggesting Supra might be MORE vulnerable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Comparison: Oracle Fallback] If Supra oracle fails, is there automatic fallback to Pyth, or would all operations dependent on Supra prices halt, causing denial of service? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Attack Vector: Sandwich Attacks] Could an attacker observe pending oracle price updates and sandwich vault operations between old and new prices to profit from the price transition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Attack Vector: MEV Extraction] Could MEV bots exploit the deterministic nature of price conversions to front-run vault operations with better prices from other sources? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Attack Vector: Oracle Front-Running] If oracle updates are visible before they're applied, could attackers front-run vault operations to execute at favorable prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Attack Vector: Gas Griefing] Could an attacker configure assets with extreme decimal differences to make price conversion operations prohibitively expensive, causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Attack Vector: Storage Bloat] Could an attacker spam oracle configurations with different pair_id encodings to bloat storage and increase operational costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Numeric Attack: Overflow Example] If price=340282366920938463463374607431768211455 (u128::MAX), decimal=1, target_decimal=10, the multiplication by 10^9 would overflow u256 - is this checked? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Numeric Attack: Underflow Example] If price=1, decimal=18, target_decimal=1, after 17 divisions by 10, the result is 0 due to integer truncation - could this zero out asset values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Numeric Attack: Precision Loss Example] Converting price=123456789012345678 from decimal=18 to decimal=6 loses 12 digits, resulting in price=123456 - a loss of 0.000000000000789012 - could this accumulate across many operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Numeric Attack: Rounding Exploitation] An attacker deposits when conversion rounds down (losing value) and withdraws when conversion rounds differently, systematically extracting rounding errors as profit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [State Corruption: Vector Mutation] If the stored pair_id vector is somehow mutated after configuration, could vector_to_pair_id() decode it to a different pair, causing permanent price feed corruption? (Critical)"
