  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: oracle_pro] [Provider Type Confusion] Can attacker manipulate OracleProviderConfig to report provider as pyth_provider() when it should be supra_provider(), causing oracle_pro to call wrong adaptor function on wrong data structure? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: oracle_pro] [Assertion Abuse] The assert at line 177 in oracle_pro only checks pair_id match - can attacker satisfy this check while providing PriceInfoObject with wrong price data, wrong timestamp, or wrong confidence? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: oracle_pro] [Historical Price Manipulation] Can attacker use get_price_unsafe_to_target_decimal() to gradually shift historical_price in oracle_pro config, then exploit with large price jump that appears normal due to manipulated history? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: oracle_pro] [Diff Threshold Timer Bypass] Can attacker use precisely timed stale prices from get_price_unsafe_to_target_decimal() to reset diff_threshold2_timer in oracle_pro, preventing price regulation warnings that should fire? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: oracle_pro] [Event Emission Gap] When InvalidOraclePrice or OracleUnavailable events are emitted in oracle_pro, do they reflect that price came from 'unsafe' Pyth path? Can this hide the source of bad price data from monitors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Deposit Price Manipulation] Can attacker time vault deposits to use stale low price from get_price_unsafe_to_target_decimal(), depositing when market price is higher, then withdraw using fresh price to extract profit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Withdrawal Price Manipulation] Can attacker time vault withdrawals to use stale high price from adaptor_pyth, withdrawing more value than entitled based on true market prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Share Calculation Attack] Since vault share prices depend on asset valuations from oracle prices, can attacker manipulate adaptor_pyth price timing to mint shares when undervalued or burn shares when overvalued? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] Can attacker use stale prices from get_price_unsafe_to_target_decimal() to make vault loss appear within tolerance when actual loss exceeds limit, bypassing operation safety checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Health Factor Manipulation] In navi_limiter adaptor, can attacker use stale Pyth prices to falsely inflate health factor, enabling unsafe borrowing that should be blocked by health checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Operation Status Bypass] Can attacker use price staleness to manipulate vault's assessment of whether operation is safe, bypassing status gates (normal/during_operation/disabled)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Multi-Asset Valuation] If vault holds multiple assets all using Pyth via adaptor_pyth, can attacker provide stale prices for subset of assets causing total portfolio valuation to be incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Request Buffer Exploitation] Can attacker submit deposit/withdrawal requests when adaptor_pyth prices are stale, locking in favorable prices that execute later when market has moved? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Fee Collection Impact] Since vault fees are calculated based on USD values from oracle prices, can stale Pyth prices cause under/over collection of fees harming protocol or users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Integration: Vault] [Liquidation Timing] Can attacker prevent or force liquidations by manipulating timing of Pyth price updates through adaptor_pyth, causing vault to liquidate at wrong times? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Math] [u64 to u256 Cast Overflow] When casting price from u64 to u256 in get_price_to_target_decimal() line 42, if subsequent multiplication in to_target_decimal_value_safe() causes result to exceed u256::MAX due to large scaling factor, will this abort or wrap? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Math] [Timestamp Arithmetic] When multiplying timestamp by 1000 in lines 19 and 32, if input timestamp is greater than (u64::MAX / 1000) = 18446744073709551, will overflow wrap to small value or abort? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Math] [Decimal Scaling Loop] In to_target_decimal_value_safe() called by get_price_to_target_decimal(), if decimal=0 and target_decimal=255, will 255 iterations of multiply-by-10 cause computational DoS or overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_pyth.move] [Math] [Division Precision Loss] When scaling down (decimal > target_decimal), can repeated division by 10 in to_target_decimal_value_safe() cause cumulative precision loss making price significantly inaccurate? (Low)"
