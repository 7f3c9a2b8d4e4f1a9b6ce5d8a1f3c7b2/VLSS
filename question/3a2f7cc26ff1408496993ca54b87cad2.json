  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: has_authority()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass authority checks by calling package-level functions directly from another module in the same package, since has_authority() only checks sender but package functions don't enforce this check? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_authority()] [Authority Takeover] Can the current authority be changed to address(0x0) or an invalid address through set_authority(), permanently locking the queue from any authority-required operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_authority()] [Authorization Chain Break] If authority is transferred to a new address, can the old authority still perform actions during the same transaction before the transfer completes, creating a race condition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: has_authority()] [Sender Spoofing] Does has_authority() correctly handle cases where ctx.sender() might be manipulated through programmable transaction blocks with multiple signers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: new()] [Initial Authority Lock] Can the authority address be set to an address that doesn't have a private key during queue creation, permanently locking administrative functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: add_existing_oracle()] [Duplicate Oracle] Can add_existing_oracle() be called multiple times with the same oracle_key to overwrite existing oracle mappings, potentially replacing legitimate oracles with malicious ones? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: add_existing_oracle()] [Oracle ID Mismatch] Can an attacker provide an oracle_id that doesn't match the actual oracle object, creating inconsistencies between oracle_key and oracle_id mappings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: add_existing_oracle()] [Table Overflow] What happens if the existing_oracles table grows unbounded? Can this cause DoS through excessive gas costs or table size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: existing_oracles_contains()] [Key Collision] Can two different oracle public keys hash to the same vector<u8> representation, causing oracle_key collisions in the table? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: add_existing_oracle()] [Empty Key Attack] Can oracle_key be an empty vector (vector::empty()), allowing multiple oracles to map to the same empty key and overwrite each other? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: add_existing_oracle()] [Oracle Removal] Is there any function to remove an oracle from existing_oracles? If not, can malicious oracles be permanently stuck in the queue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Fee Overflow] Can the fee parameter be set to u64::MAX causing overflow when fees are calculated (fee * number_of_operations)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Zero Fee Recipient] Can fee_recipient be set to address(0x0), causing collected fees to be sent to an inaccessible address? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Min Attestations Zero] Can min_attestations be set to 0, allowing oracles to submit data without any threshold, compromising data integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Oracle Validity Zero] Can oracle_validity_length_ms be set to 0, making all oracle submissions immediately invalid/stale? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Oracle Validity Overflow] Can oracle_validity_length_ms be set to u64::MAX, causing timestamp overflow when checking (current_time + oracle_validity_length_ms)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Fee Recipient Front-running] Can authority change fee_recipient right before fees are collected to redirect fees to themselves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Min Attestations Manipulation] Can min_attestations be lowered to 1 temporarily to allow single oracle submissions, then raised back after malicious data is submitted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Extreme Validity Period] Can oracle_validity_length_ms be set to an extremely long period (e.g., 100 years), allowing stale data to be considered valid indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: new()] [Guardian Self-Reference] When is_guardian_queue is true, guardian_queue_id is set to its own ID - can this create circular dependencies or infinite recursion in guardian checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: new()] [Guardian Queue Impersonation] Can a regular queue be created with guardian_queue_id pointing to itself, making it appear as a guardian queue without proper initialization? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [Guardian Replacement] Can guardian_queue_id be changed to point to a malicious guardian queue, compromising the entire oracle network's security model? (Critical)",
