  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add_mut()] [Reference Safety] The function dereferences *a twice at line 92 (once to call add(), once to assign) - can this cause race conditions or inconsistent state if called concurrently on vault balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_mut()] [Reference Safety] The function dereferences *a twice at line 114 - if the reference is invalidated between calls (e.g., through a callback), can this cause use-after-free or stale balance updates in vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add_mut()] [Overflow Persistence] If add() overflows at line 92, the corrupted result is written back to *a - can this permanently corrupt mutable vault balances, requiring expensive recovery operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_mut()] [Underflow Persistence] If sub() produces an incorrect sign at line 114, the corrupted result is written back to *a - can this flip vault balances from positive to negative, enabling unauthorized withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add_mut()] [No Rollback] If add_mut() is called in a transaction that later aborts, is the mutation to *a rolled back correctly by Move VM, or can partial updates persist in vault state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Constant: DECIMALS] [Hardcoded Value] DECIMALS is hardcoded to 18 at line 5 - if Volo Vault integrates with protocols using different decimal bases (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals), can this mismatch cause catastrophic price conversion errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Constant: DECIMALS] [No Configuration] Since DECIMALS cannot be changed without module upgrade, can a bug in decimal conversion calculations be unfixable in deployed vault contracts, requiring full migration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: dec()] [Unused Parameter] The dec() function takes a &Decimal parameter at line 30 but doesn't use it - can this cause confusion where callers expect per-instance decimal precision in vault price feeds? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Constant: DECIMALS] [Module-Wide Scope] DECIMALS at line 5 is module-scoped but not configurable - if different vault adaptors need different precisions (e.g., Navi vs Suilend), can this limitation cause integration errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Constant: DECIMALS] [Type System Limitation] Since DECIMALS is u8 (max 255) and used in pow_10(), but u128 can only represent up to 10^38, is there a mismatch between the type system limits and mathematical limits in scale_to_decimals()? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Invariant: add/sub inverse] Can add(a, b) followed by sub(result, b) fail to return a due to overflow/underflow, breaking vault balance update reversibility in failed operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Invariant: comparison consistency] Can gt(a, b) && gt(b, a) both be true due to overflow, causing vault risk limit checks to be inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Invariant: zero identity] Is add(a, zero()) always equal to a, or can negative zero at line 11 cause identity violations in vault balance accumulations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Invariant: sign consistency] After any operation (add/sub/scale), is the sign (neg flag) consistently interpreted across all comparison and arithmetic functions in vault calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Invariant: precision preservation] Can scale_to_decimals() followed by inverse scale_to_decimals() recover the original value, or does rounding cause irreversible loss in vault price feeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Switchboard Price Scaling] If Switchboard oracle returns SUI/USD price with 9 decimals, and vault expects 18 decimals, can an attacker manipulate the oracle update timing to exploit rounding errors in scale_to_decimals()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: new()] [Oracle Negative Prices] Can an attacker construct a malicious oracle feed that reports negative prices (neg=true) to cause vault total_usd_value to become negative, bypassing loss_tolerance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Price Aggregation Overflow] If vault aggregates prices from multiple oracles using add(), can overflow in add_internal() cause the aggregated price to wrap to a small value, undervaluing vault assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: gt()] [Price Staleness Check] If vault checks oracle staleness using gt(new_timestamp, old_timestamp), can negative timestamps or overflow cause stale prices to appear fresh, bypassing staleness validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Multi-Oracle Precision] If vault uses multiple oracles with different decimal bases (6, 9, 18), and scale_to_decimals() is used to normalize, can precision loss cause arbitrage opportunities between oracle price conversions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Share Minting Overflow] If vault calculates shares_to_mint using add() on deposited amounts, can overflow cause shares_to_mint to wrap to a small value, giving attacker massive shares for tiny deposit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Share Burning Underflow] If vault calculates shares_to_burn using sub() on withdrawal amounts, can underflow cause shares_to_burn to become negative, allowing attacker to increase their shares instead of decreasing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Fee Calculation Precision] If vault fees are calculated by scaling basis points to 18 decimals using scale_to_decimals(), can rounding errors allow attacker to avoid fees or cause vault to collect excessive fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: min()] [Slippage Protection Bypass] If vault uses min(expected_shares, calculated_shares) for slippage protection, can negative values or overflow cause min() to return an unexpectedly large value, bypassing slippage checks? (Critical)",
