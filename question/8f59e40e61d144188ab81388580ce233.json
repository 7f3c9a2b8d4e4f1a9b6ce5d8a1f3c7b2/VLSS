  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Last Update Initialization] If last_update_at is initialized to zero, the first duration calculation could be massive - is this handled correctly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Future Timestamps] If clock can somehow provide future timestamps, can this break duration calculation or allow premature reward claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Zero Total Balance] When total_balance is zero, no rewards accrue - but can users stake just before claiming to get unfair rewards from accumulated zero-balance periods? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Zero User Balance] When user_balance is zero at line 95-99, ray_mul will return zero - but can user manipulate timing to have zero balance during calculation but non-zero during claim? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Effective Balance Calculation] The function calls get_effective_balance at line 30 - can this return inflated values if boosting or multiplier mechanisms exist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Cross-Asset Interactions] If user has positions in multiple assets, can rewards from one asset affect calculations for another asset through shared state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Multiple Rules Per Asset] The inner loop processes all rules for each asset - can overlapping rules cause double-counting of rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Rule Priority] Is there any priority or ordering between rules, and can attackers exploit rule ordering to maximize rewards unfairly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Tuple Return Integrity] The function returns 5 vectors as tuple - can the caller misinterpret or mismatch the vectors if they're used separately? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Empty Return Values] If user has no claimable rewards, all vectors are empty - does calling code handle empty vectors correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Assertion Failures] The function uses assertions with codes 1, 2, 3 - are these error codes documented and properly handled by callers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Index Update Race] The calculated global_index is not persisted in this function - can there be race between calculation and actual update in storage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [User Index Staleness] The user_index retrieved at line 102 may be stale - can this lead to incorrect reward calculations if user index is updated concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Global vs User Index Sync] The function calculates global_index at line 38 and uses it at line 39 - can user_index be updated between these calls causing inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Pool Insolvency Check] The function calculates claimable rewards but doesn't verify reward pool has sufficient funds - can users see claimable rewards they cannot actually claim? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Unlimited Accrual] There's no cap on index_increased - can rewards accrue indefinitely even if reward pool is empty, creating unpayable debt? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Reward Cap Absence] User rewards can grow unbounded - is there a maximum reward per user or can early users drain entire pool? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Compound Overflow] If rate and duration are both near maximum, can their multiplication at line 88 overflow even within u256 bounds? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Division First Loss] The calculation (rate * duration) / total_balance does multiplication first - can this cause precision loss if done in different order? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Ray Math Precision Loss] ray_mul may round down - can users exploit this by making many small reward claims to accumulate rounding losses in protocol's favor? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rounding Direction] When index_increased has remainder from division, it rounds down - can this be exploited to minimize rewards paid? (Low)",
