  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Module: lending_core::pool] [Test Function Exposure] Are test_only functions (init_for_testing, create_pool_for_testing, etc.) properly gated in production builds, or can they be called to bypass authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: get_pool_info()] [Information Disclosure] Can test_only function get_pool_info() be called in production to extract sensitive balance information that should be restricted? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: uid()] [UID Exposure] Does exposing the pool's UID through uid() function enable object capability exploits where attackers can manipulate dynamic fields or extensions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: Pool] [Store Ability] Since Pool has store ability, can it be wrapped in another object and have its fields manipulated through that wrapper, bypassing friend restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: PoolAdminCap] [Store Ability] Since PoolAdminCap has store ability, can it be stored in a shared object accessible by multiple parties, undermining single-admin security model? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_balance()] [Balance Ownership] Does deposit_balance() verify that the Balance<CoinType> parameter originated from legitimate sources, or can arbitrary balances be created and deposited? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Balance Return] Does the caller of withdraw_balance() properly handle the returned Balance<CoinType>, or can it be dropped/destroyed, causing accounting mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Pool Uniqueness] Can multiple Pool<CoinType> instances be created for the same CoinType, and if so, how do dependent modules determine which pool to use? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Event Accuracy] Does the PoolWithdrawReserve event accurately reflect the withdrawal, or can the before/after values be manipulated by concurrent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Module: lending_core::pool] [Upgrade Safety] If the module is upgraded, can the Pool struct fields be modified, orphaning existing shared Pool objects with incompatible schemas? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Balance Accounting] Can deposit_treasury() be called when pool.balance is exactly equal to deposit_amount, reducing balance to zero and breaking dependent protocols that assume non-zero liquidity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Accounting Invariant] Does moving funds from balance to treasury_balance maintain total pool value invariant (balance + treasury_balance = constant), or can value be lost in the transfer? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Treasury Depletion] Can withdraw_treasury() drain the entire treasury_balance, and if so, what are the implications for protocol fees or reserves that depend on treasury funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Reserve Depletion] Can withdraw_reserve_balance() drain pool.balance to zero, causing failure in subsequent deposit/withdraw operations from legitimate users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Balance Overflow] If coin::value(&mint_coin) returns u64::MAX, can balance::join() overflow pool.balance, causing silent wrapping and balance corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_balance()] [Balance Overflow] Can repeated calls to deposit_balance() with large Balance<CoinType> values cause pool.balance to overflow beyond u64 limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Balance Underflow] If amount parameter is larger than pool.balance, does balance::split() abort or silently underflow, and is the error message clear? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Balance Underflow] Can the balance::split() call in withdraw_balance() underflow if concurrent withdrawals deplete pool.balance before this transaction executes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Double Accounting] Does the balance::split() followed by balance::join() maintain atomicity, or can a failure in join() leave funds in limbo between pool.balance and treasury_balance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Double Withdrawal] Can withdraw_treasury() be called multiple times in the same transaction to withdraw more than the treasury_balance through reentrancy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: Pool] [Balance Separation] What is the intended semantic difference between pool.balance and pool.treasury_balance, and can confusion between them lead to incorrect fund allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Coin Value Caching] Is the mint_value variable necessary, or can coin::value() be called after coin::into_balance(), potentially yielding different results? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_balance()] [Balance Value Caching] Similarly, can balance::value() change between the initial call and balance::join(), causing event emission to show incorrect amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Transfer Atomicity] Is the transfer::public_transfer() call atomic with the balance::split(), or can the withdrawal complete but transfer fail, locking funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Zero Return] The zero-value special case returns balance::zero<CoinType>() - can this be distinguished from a legitimate withdrawal of zero, causing accounting confusion? (Low)"
