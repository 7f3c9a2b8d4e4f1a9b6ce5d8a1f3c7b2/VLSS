  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Volo Vault Integration] If Volo Vault's Suilend adaptor references lending markets through the registry, could an attacker create a malicious market with the same type parameter to redirect vault funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Market Discovery] Without a public lookup function, how do Volo Vault adaptors find the correct lending market ID? Could this lead to integration errors or security issues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Cross-Protocol Attack] If multiple protocols rely on the same registry, could an attacker create a market that exploits differences in how protocols validate market legitimacy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Single Registry Assumption] The code assumes a single global registry. Could multiple registry deployments cause confusion or enable market spoofing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Pause Mechanism] There's no way to pause market creation. Could this prevent emergency response during an active exploit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Market Validation] The registry doesn't validate market properties before registration. Could malicious markets with extreme parameters (e.g., 100% interest rates) be registered? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Whitelist] There's no whitelist of allowed type parameters. Could this enable registration of markets for unsupported or dangerous asset types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Market Count Limit] The registry has no limit on the number of markets. Could unlimited market creation strain system resources? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Event Emission] The function doesn't emit any events. Could this make monitoring for malicious market creation difficult? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Query Functions] There are no public functions to query registered markets. Could this force users to interact with untrusted off-chain indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Market Metadata] The registry only stores IDs, no metadata like creator, creation timestamp, or validation status. Could this make auditing and governance difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Single Initialization] The init function can only be called once during module publication. Could this make testing or upgrades difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [No Setup Validation] The init function creates an empty registry without any validation. Could this allow deployment with incorrect configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Immediate Sharing] The registry is shared immediately without any setup period. Could this allow exploitation before proper monitoring is in place? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Front-Running] Could an attacker monitor mempool for legitimate market creation transactions and front-run them to register the type first? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Squatting Attack] Could an attacker pre-register markets for all popular asset types, then demand payment to transfer the OwnerCaps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Market Monopolization] The first creator of a market for type P has permanent control. Could this lead to monopolistic behavior or rent-seeking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [DoS by First Registration] Could an attacker register markets with unfavorable terms for all viable asset types, preventing legitimate market creation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Upgrade Path] If CURRENT_VERSION increases, existing markets become inaccessible. Is there a migration path for market owners? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Registry Upgrade] If the Registry struct needs new fields, how can it be upgraded without breaking existing references? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Module Upgrade] If the lending_market_registry module is upgraded, could it break existing OwnerCaps or LendingMarkets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Migration] If the table structure needs to change, is there a way to migrate existing entries? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [TxContext Usage] The function passes TxContext to lending_market::create_lending_market. Could the lending_market module misuse transaction context data (sender, epoch, etc.)? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Sender Assumption] The function doesn't validate tx_context::sender(). Could contracts or multi-sig wallets create markets with unexpected ownership models? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Init Context] The init function uses ctx without validation. Could this allow deployment with incorrect initial parameters? (Low)"
