  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: reserve_array_index()] [Slow Lookup] Comment says 'slow function, use sparingly' but returns vector::length if not found - can this out-of-bounds index cause panics when used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: reserve()] [Unchecked Index] Calls reserve_array_index then borrows from vector without checking if index is valid - will panic if type not found? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [All Functions] [Index Parameter] Most functions take reserve_array_index as u64 parameter from caller - can caller pass out-of-bounds index to panic transaction intentionally? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Event Timing] LiquidateEvent emitted before exemption returned to liquidator - can event be used to front-run liquidator's redemption? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: forgive()] [No Authorization Event] ForgiveEvent doesn't log who authorized forgiveness (owner cap not referenced) - can malicious owner hide responsibility? (Medium)",
