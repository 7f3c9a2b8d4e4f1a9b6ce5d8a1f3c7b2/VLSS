  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [State Inconsistency] Does version_migrate() only update storage.version without migrating actual data structures, causing old reserve data to be incompatible with new version logic expectations?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: version_verification()] [Missing Validation] Does version_verification() fail to check if storage.version exceeds maximum supported version, allowing future-incompatible versions to interact with current logic?
