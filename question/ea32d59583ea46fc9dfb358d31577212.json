  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Return Value Usage] Since the function returns both LendingMarketOwnerCap and LendingMarket (line 39), if the caller drops or mishandles these objects, could the registry contain an ID pointing to a destroyed market? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [ID Staleness] Since the registry stores object IDs (line 18) but has no mechanism to update them if LendingMarket objects are wrapped or their IDs change, could the registry maintain stale references? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Duplicate Prevention] While table::add prevents duplicate TypeName entries (line 38), if a LendingMarket can be created through a different path bypassing the registry, could there be multiple markets for the same type P with only one registered? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Registry-Market Mismatch] If a LendingMarket internally stores metadata that should match the registry's TypeName key, but create_lending_market doesn't enforce this, could markets be created with mismatched type information? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Front-Running] Since create_lending_market is public and first-caller gets the OwnerCap (line 39), could a MEV bot monitor mempool for market creation transactions and front-run to steal admin privileges for valuable market types? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Concurrent Creation] If two transactions attempt to create markets for the same type P concurrently, the first will succeed and second will abort at table::add (line 38)—could this cause failed transactions to lose gas while achieving nothing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization Race] If multiple parties try to deploy the module simultaneously, could init be called multiple times creating multiple Registry shared objects, causing confusion about which is canonical? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Check TOCTOU] Between the version check at line 35 and the table::add at line 38, if a package upgrade changes behavior, could this create a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Shared vs Owned] Since LendingMarket is returned as an owned object (line 39) but the registry tracks its ID (line 38), if the caller shares or transfers the market, does the registry tracking remain valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Owner Cap Transfer] Since LendingMarketOwnerCap is returned to the caller (line 39), if this cap is transferred or sold, could registry tracking become divorced from actual market ownership? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Market Destruction] If a LendingMarket can be destroyed or deleted, but the registry has no mechanism to remove the stale ID entry (line 38), could this cause permanent registry pollution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Deletion Function] Since there's no function to remove entries from lending_markets table (line 18), could markets that need to be deprecated or upgraded become permanent entries blocking type name reuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Object ID Uniqueness] Does object::id(&lending_market) at line 38 guarantee a unique ID per market, or could ID collisions occur if markets are created in bulk transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [lending_market Module Trust] Since create_lending_market fully trusts the lending_market::create_lending_market function (line 37), if that function has vulnerabilities in market initialization, could they be inherited by the registry? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Table Module Dependency] If the sui::table module has bugs in table::add operations (line 38), could this cause registry state corruption despite correct local logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [TypeName Module Dependency] If type_name::get<P>() has vulnerabilities allowing type name spoofing or collision (line 38), could attackers manipulate registry entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Cross-Package Market Creation] If lending_market::create_lending_market can be called directly from other packages bypassing the registry, could unregistered markets be created violating the 'single market per type' invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Shared Object Composability] Since Registry is shared (line 28), if other modules take mutable references to it in complex transaction compositions, could this enable reentrancy or state corruption attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Lookup Function] Since there's no public function to query the lending_markets table (line 18) by TypeName, how can users verify which markets exist or retrieve market IDs for interaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Market Enumeration] Without a way to enumerate all registered markets, could this make market discovery impossible for integrators or front-ends? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Market Validation] Since create_lending_market doesn't validate the returned LendingMarket's structure or initial state (line 37), could malicious or buggy lending_market module return invalid markets that get registered? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Pause Mechanism] If the protocol needs to pause market creation during an emergency, there's no pause flag or admin control—could this prevent timely incident response? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Creation Fees] Since market creation is free (no payment required), could this enable spam attacks creating thousands of useless markets? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Metadata Storage] Since the registry only stores IDs (line 18), not market metadata like creation time, creator, or status, could this make auditing or governance difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Event Emission] Since no events are emitted when markets are created, how can off-chain systems track new market registrations or monitor for suspicious creations? (Low)"
