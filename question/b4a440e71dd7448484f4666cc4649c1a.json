  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: as_u32()] [Repeated Conversions] Tests frequently call as_u32() on I32 values - if conversions are expensive and done repeatedly in hot paths, could gas costs of signed arithmetic become prohibitive? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i32] [Implementation Status] All functions abort with 'abort 0' - is this intended stub/placeholder, or are implementations missing? If missing, when deployed will cause total DoS of any dependent code? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i32] [Specification] No function documentation or pre/post conditions - without specs, how can callers know when overflow/underflow checking happens vs wrapping behavior, leading to incorrect usage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Tests: Expected Failures] [Error Communication] Multiple tests use #[expected_failure] without specific error code - do tests verify correct error (EOverflow) or accept any abort, potentially missing wrong error scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i32] [Dependency Risk] Module is in local_dependencies suggesting vendored copy - if upstream mmt_v3 has bug fixes or security patches, will outdated local copy remain vulnerable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: add()] [Associativity] If add() implementation has rounding errors or overflow in intermediate steps, could (a + b) + c differ from a + (b + c) causing accumulated differences in long chains of additions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: mul()] [Distributivity] If mul() then add() doesn't equal add() then mul() due to overflow handling, could fee calculations like (price * amount) + fee differ from price * (amount + fee/price)? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: div()] [Precision Loss] Integer division truncates - if vault calculations chain multiple div() operations, could accumulated truncation error cause significant value loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: div()] [Rounding Direction] Tests don't specify rounding direction for negative division - does div(from(10), from(3)) == 3 and div(neg_from(10), from(3)) == neg_from(3) (round toward zero), or different rounding? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: mod()] [Remainder Sign] If mod() result can be negative, could unexpected negative remainders in price calculations cause invalid tick positions or off-by-one errors? (Medium)"
