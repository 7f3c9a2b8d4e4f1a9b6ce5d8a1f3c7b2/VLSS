  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Staleness Exploit] Can admin set update_interval to maximum u64 to allow extremely stale prices to be accepted, enabling price manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Zero Interval] Can set_update_interval be set to 0 (noting MAX_UPDATE_INTERVAL constant is 0) to require fresh price every call, causing DoS if oracle updates lag? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Retroactive Change] If update_interval is reduced after prices are cached, does this invalidate existing cached prices and force immediate updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Slippage Manipulation] Can admin set dex_slippage to 0 to cause all DEX operations to fail slippage checks, DoSing vault operations? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Parameter Validation] Does set_dex_slippage validate reasonable slippage bounds (e.g., <= 10%) or can any u256 value be set? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee()] [Fee Drain] Can admin call retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee with amount exceeding deposit_withdraw_fee_collected.value(), causing underflow or panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee()] [Reentrancy] Can retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee be exploited in nested calls to drain more fees than collected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee()] [Timing Attack] Can admin retrieve all fees immediately before users expect fee distribution, violating fee sharing expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee()] [Accounting Error] Does retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee properly update deposit_withdraw_fee_collected balance or can double-retrieval occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()] [Privilege Escalation] Can operator retrieve fees without any amount limits or freeze checks, draining all collected fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()] [No Freeze Check] Does retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator check if operator is frozen before allowing fee retrieval? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()] [Duplicate Functionality] Why do both admin and operator have identical retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee function without differentiation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()] [Race Condition] Can multiple operators race to retrieve fees, causing first operator to drain all fees before others? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator()] [Balance Tracking] Does retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator emit event to track which operator retrieved fees and when? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Double Initialization] Can create_reward_manager be called multiple times to create multiple reward managers for same vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Vault Association] Does create_reward_manager verify vault is in correct state (not during operation, has reward_manager = address(0)) before creating? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Timing Attack] Can create_reward_manager be called after deposits exist, causing early depositors to lose rewards not tracked before manager creation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Integration Risk] Does create_reward_manager properly initialize reward manager with correct vault reference and share tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Forced Reset Attack] Can admin call reset_loss_tolerance(by_admin=true) mid-epoch to reset cur_epoch_loss, allowing additional losses beyond limit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Race Condition] Can admin front-run end_op_value_update_with_bag by resetting tolerance to allow operation that would otherwise fail ERR_EXCEED_LOSS_LIMIT? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [State Corruption] Does reset_loss_tolerance properly update cur_epoch_loss_base_usd_value to current total_usd_value, or can stale base value cause incorrect loss calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Epoch Manipulation] Can reset_loss_tolerance be called multiple times in same epoch to repeatedly reset loss counter? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Timing Attack] Can reset_loss_tolerance be called immediately before risky operation to provide maximum loss headroom? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Authorization Chain] Can attacker exploit sequence of admin functions to achieve unauthorized state (e.g., upgrade_vault + set_enabled + set_loss_tolerance to corrupt vault)? (High)"
