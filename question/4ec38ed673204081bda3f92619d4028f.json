  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [CoinType Asset Inflation] If coin_type_asset_balance.value() exceeds the borrowed amount, can operators inflate vault balances through repeated borrow/return cycles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Status Race Condition] Between `assert_during_operation()` and setting status back to normal, can another transaction start a new operation, causing status inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Value Update Flag Manipulation] Can an attacker call `enable_op_value_update()` without properly ending the operation, allowing premature value update checks that bypass loss detection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Bag Destroy Attack] If defi_assets bag is not truly empty due to extra assets being added, does `destroy_empty()` panic and DoS the operation completion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Asset Key Parsing Inconsistency] If `vault_utils::parse_key()` behavior differs between start and end operations, can assets be borrowed with one key but returned to a different key, causing loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Zero Balance Return] If coin_type_asset_balance is zero but destroy_zero() is not called (lines 288-292), can this cause balance object leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Receipt Asset Handling] Receipt assets (lines 267-271) are handled like other DeFi assets, but can receipt duplication or modification during operations cause vault receipt accounting corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Navi AccountCap Swap] Can an attacker return a different NaviAccountCap than borrowed (same type but different account), stealing the original account's funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Cetus Position Manipulation] Can operators modify Cetus position parameters during operations and return manipulated positions, affecting vault valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Suilend Obligation State Change] Can returning a SuilendObligationOwnerCap with accumulated debt or modified collateral violate vault safety constraints? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Momentum Position Corruption] Can momentum position state changes during operations cause unexpected losses that aren't detected by value update checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Asset Return Verification Bypass] The function checks if assets are returned (lines 321-351) but only for 4 out of 5 asset types - Receipt is not checked. Can attackers keep receipts borrowed, causing accounting corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Vault ID Substitution] Can an attacker use TxBagForCheckValueUpdate from vault A on vault B if vault IDs collide or are manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] If total_usd_value_after < total_usd_value_before but the loss equals exactly the remaining tolerance, can update_tolerance() overflow or accept one more loss than intended? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Share Supply Manipulation] If vault.total_shares() at line 366 differs from the snapshot in TxBagForCheckValueUpdate due to concurrent deposits/withdrawals, can this be exploited to bypass share verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Oracle Manipulation Attack] Can an attacker manipulate the clock or oracle between start_op and end_op_value_update to show artificial gains, bypassing loss tolerance? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Value Update Record Bypass] Can `check_op_value_update_record()` be called multiple times or bypassed entirely if operations complete out of order? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Status Transition Attack] Can an attacker prevent status from being set back to VAULT_NORMAL_STATUS by causing the function to revert after line 375, permanently locking the vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Loss Underflow] If total_usd_value_after > total_usd_value_before due to rewards, is the loss calculation (line 362) safe from underflow, or can it wrap around? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Clear Record Timing] If `clear_op_value_update_record()` is called but status setting fails, can this lead to inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Epoch Boundary Loss Reset] Can an attacker time operations across epoch boundaries to reset loss tolerance mid-operation, bypassing loss limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Asset Presence Check Weakness] The `contains_asset_type()` check only verifies asset existence, not value or integrity. Can operators return degraded assets that pass the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Generic Type Confusion] Can providing wrong ObligationType generic cause the asset return check to pass for wrong obligation types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Event Spoofing] Can incorrect loss values in OperationValueUpdateChecked event mislead off-chain systems about vault health? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_value_update_with_bag()] [Zero Loss Edge Case] If loss is exactly 0, does update_tolerance(0) handle it correctly without causing state inconsistency? (Low)"
