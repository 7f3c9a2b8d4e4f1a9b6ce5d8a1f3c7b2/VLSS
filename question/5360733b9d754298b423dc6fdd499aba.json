(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Option Type Validation] calculate_global_index() checks rule.option against supply/borrow constants then aborts on else - can new option types added later cause all index calculations to abort, DoSing rewards?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Duration Overflow] calculate_global_index() computes duration = now - last_update_at without overflow check - if now < last_update_at due to clock manipulation, does subtraction underflow causing massive duration? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Zero Total Balance] calculate_global_index() returns index_increased=0 if total_balance=0 - can attacker drain all supply/borrow to freeze global_index, preventing rewards from accruing to future users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Multiplication Overflow] calculate_global_index() computes (rule.rate * duration) / total_balance - can very large rate or duration cause overflow before division?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Index Diff Underflow] calculate_user_reward() computes user_index_diff = global_index - get_user_index_by_rule() - if user_index > global_index due to bug, does subtraction underflow causing massive diff? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Ray Mul Precision Loss] calculate_user_reward() uses ray_mul(user_balance, user_index_diff) - can precision loss in ray_mul() allow attacker to manipulate user_balance to extract more rewards than entitled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Reward Addition Overflow] calculate_user_reward() returns user_reward + ray_mul(...) - if addition overflows u256, can attacker trigger overflow to wrap rewards back to small value? (Critical)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_deposit()] [Dual Incentive Update] entry_deposit() updates both incentive_v2 and incentive_v3 - can inconsistency between v2 and v3 state allow user to game rewards by manipulating update order? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_with_account_cap()] [No Amount Validation] deposit_with_account_cap() doesn't validate deposit_coin amount - can zero deposits pollute storage and trigger reward updates wastefully? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: borrow_with_account_cap()] [Fee Deposit After Borrow] borrow_with_account_cap() borrows amount+fee then deposits fee - if borrow succeeds but deposit_borrow_fee() fails, is fee lost causing accounting error?
