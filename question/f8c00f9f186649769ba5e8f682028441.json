  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Vec Feeds Growth] Does cfg.vec_feeds vector grow unbounded as feeds are created, and can this cause DoS when iterating in config::is_price_feed_exists()? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: disable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Primary Check] Does config::set_oracle_provider_config_enable() properly check if the provider being disabled is currently primary, preventing primary from being disabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: enable_supra_oracle_provider()] [Prior Setup] Can a provider be enabled before its pair_id is set, causing oracle lookups to use empty/default pair_id? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_pyth_oracle_provider_config()] [Pyth Contract] Does the code validate that Pyth contract exists and pair_id is valid before config creation, or can invalid Pyth references be stored? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_supra_oracle_provider_config()] [Supra Contract] Does the code verify Supra contract is deployed and pair_id exists before creating config, or can references to non-existent Supra feeds be created?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed()] [TTL Retroactive] When historical_price_ttl is changed, does it affect already-stored history data, and can reducing TTL cause previously valid history to become invalid mid-operation?
