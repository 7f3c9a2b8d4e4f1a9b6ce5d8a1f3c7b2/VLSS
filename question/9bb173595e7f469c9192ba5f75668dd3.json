  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Resource Leak] Does aggregator.delete() at line 26 properly clean up all nested resources (UpdateState.results vector, CurrentResult), or can deletion leave orphaned memory/storage consuming chain resources? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [UID Destruction] Does aggregator.delete() call id.delete() to destroy the UID, or can improper UID cleanup leave ghost objects that prevent ID reuse and consume storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Circular Reference] If Aggregator holds references to Queue and Queue references Aggregator, can deletion create dangling references where Queue still points to deleted aggregator, causing access violations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Update Vector Cleanup] Aggregator contains UpdateState with results vector (up to MAX_RESULTS=16 items)—does delete() at line 26 properly drop all vector elements, or can large vectors cause gas exhaustion during cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Reference Staleness] After deletion, can Volo Vault's OracleConfig still reference the deleted aggregator address, causing get_asset_price() calls to fail or return zero, breaking vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Feed Hash Orphan] Does deletion clean up references in the Queue's feed_hash mapping, or can deleted aggregator's feed_hash remain registered, preventing new aggregators from using the same feed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Shared Object Cleanup] Since Aggregator is a shared object (transfer::share_object), does calling delete() properly remove it from shared object storage, or can ghost entries persist causing storage leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [CurrentResult Nested Data] CurrentResult contains multiple Decimal fields (result, min_result, max_result, stdev, range, mean)—does delete() recursively clean these up, or can Decimal internal state leak? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Consistency] After deleting aggregator, does the parent Queue update its aggregator count or list, or can Queue maintain stale references causing queue operations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle ID Reuse] After aggregator.delete() destroys the UID, can the same oracle ID be immediately reused for a new aggregator, causing confusion in update tracking since old Update entries reference the same oracle ID? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Deletion During Update] If aggregator.add_result() is being called concurrently with run(), can partial updates corrupt state before deletion completes, or can deletion fail due to locked resources? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Authority Transfer Residue] If authority was recently transferred via set_authority(), can old authority metadata remain after deletion, leaking sensitive access control information? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Price Data Loss] Can deletion permanently lose historical price data stored in UpdateState if there's no backup mechanism, causing audit or compliance issues for Volo Vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Config Cleanup] Does deletion trigger cleanup in aggregator configs (min_sample_size, max_staleness_seconds, max_variance, min_responses), or can stale config remain in memory? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Dependent Object Cascade] If other contracts hold references to this aggregator (e.g., Volo Vault's PriceInfo), does deletion cascade to clean those references, or do they become dangling pointers? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [String Memory Leak] Aggregator contains a String field (name)—does delete() at line 26 properly deallocate the string bytes, or can string storage leak? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Timestamp Cleanup] Does deletion reset created_at_ms timestamp to prevent confusion if an aggregator with same ID is recreated with different creation time? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vector Capacity Leak] If UpdateState.results vector has allocated capacity > length, does delete() reclaim unused capacity or only drop stored elements, leaking allocated memory? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Feed Hash Collision] After deletion, can a new aggregator reuse the same feed_hash, causing oracle subscribers to confuse new feed with deleted one, feeding wrong prices to Volo Vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [VecSet Cleanup] Does UpdateState use vec_set for oracle tracking—if so, does delete() properly clear the set, or can zombie oracle IDs persist? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Deletion Finality] Is aggregator deletion final and irreversible, or can some recovery mechanism resurrect deleted aggregators, causing state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Decimal Resource Cleanup] Decimal struct may hold u128/u256 values internally—does delete() handle large decimal cleanup without arithmetic overflow during deallocation? (Low)",
