  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Ratio Zero Edge Case] When ratio=0 (supply=0, tvl>0 case from ratio()), shares become 0 for any amount. Can this lock user funds if they stake but receive 0 shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Maximum Ratio Attack] When ratio=RATIO_MAX (tvl=0 case), amount * RATIO_MAX / RATIO_MAX = amount, so shares equals amount. Is this safe for initial deposits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Precision Loss Accumulation] Over many deposits, does the rounding down in line 35 cause cumulative precision loss that could drain the pool or undercollateralize shares? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Sandwich Attack via Rounding] Can an attacker sandwich user transactions by manipulating the ratio to maximize their shares while minimizing victims' shares through rounding behavior? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Dust Amount Exploit] Can an attacker stake 1 wei (smallest amount) repeatedly to exploit the minimum 1 share guarantee at line 38, effectively getting free shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Integer Division Timing] Since shares = (amount * ratio) / RATIO_MAX, does the order matter? Could restructuring as (amount / RATIO_MAX) * ratio reduce precision loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Large Amount Overflow] When amount=U64_MAX and ratio=RATIO_MAX, does amount * ratio = (2^64-1) * 1e18 overflow u256, or is u256 sufficient? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Mutable Shares Variable] Line 35 declares shares as mutable and potentially modifies it at line 38. Could this mutable state lead to unexpected behavior if the function is inlined or optimized? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Zero Ratio Panic] Line 45 asserts ratio != 0 with E_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO. When can ratio be 0 (supply=0, tvl>0), and does this DoS unstaking operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Precision Loss on Unstake] amount = shares * RATIO_MAX / ratio rounds down. Can users lose SUI value when unstaking due to this rounding, especially with high ratio values? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [U64 Overflow Check] The assertion at line 47 checks amount <= U64_MAX. When shares * RATIO_MAX overflows, is this caught properly before casting at line 48? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Zero Shares Input] When shares=0, the function returns amount=0. Is this safe for all calling contexts, or could it cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Maximum Shares Edge Case] When shares=U64_MAX and ratio is small, does shares * RATIO_MAX overflow u256 capacity? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Ratio Manipulation Attack] If an attacker can influence the ratio between their deposit and withdrawal, can they extract more SUI than deposited by exploiting rounding in both to_shares() and from_shares()? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Undercollateralization Impact] When ratio > RATIO_MAX (pool undercollateralized), the ratio() function panics. But if a stale high ratio is passed to from_shares(), users get less SUI than expected. Is this safe? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Rounding Down Bias] The division at line 46 always rounds down, favoring the protocol over users. Can this accumulate to significant value over time or many transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Casting Safety] When casting amount from u256 to u64 at line 48, if the assertion at line 47 is somehow bypassed, could this produce incorrect values? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Zero Amount Output] When shares * RATIO_MAX / ratio < 1, amount rounds to 0. Can users burn shares but receive 0 SUI, effectively losing their stake? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares() + from_shares()] [Round-Trip Invariant] If a user stakes X SUI via to_shares() then immediately unstakes via from_shares(), do they get exactly X SUI back, or does rounding cause value loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares() + from_shares()] [Rounding Bias Accumulation] The to_shares() minimum 1 share guarantee and from_shares() rounding down create opposite biases. Can these be exploited in combination? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: ratio() + to_shares()] [Initial Deposit Attack] At pool initialization, ratio() returns RATIO_MAX when tvl=0. Can the first depositor stake 1 SUI via to_shares() and receive disproportionate control due to the minimum share guarantee? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: ratio() + from_shares()] [Zero Ratio DoS] If supply=0 and tvl>0, ratio() returns 0, causing from_shares() to panic at line 45. Can this DoS all unstaking operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: mul_div() usage] [Indirect Usage Vulnerabilities] If mul_div() is called by higher-level stake/unstake functions, can the precision loss or rounding behavior be exploited through those interfaces? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: ratio() calculation] [Supply-TVL Desync] If supply and tvl become desynced due to external factors (slashing, rewards), can the ratio() calculation produce dangerous values that break to_shares() or from_shares()? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/math.move] [Function: to_shares() + ratio()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can an attacker use a flash loan to temporarily manipulate tvl in ratio(), then call to_shares() with the manipulated ratio to mint excessive shares? (Critical)"
