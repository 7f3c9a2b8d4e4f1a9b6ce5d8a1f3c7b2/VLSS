  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Missing Authorization] Since update_after_request_deposit() has package visibility, can any module in the volo_vault package call it to manipulate receipt state without proper authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Package-Level Bypass] Can a malicious module within the volo_vault package call update_after_cancel_deposit() to reset status to NORMAL without actually canceling any deposit, bypassing state machine constraints? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Unauthorized Execution] Since update_after_execute_withdraw() is package-visible, can an attacker exploit a compromised or buggy module in volo_vault to execute withdrawals without proper validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reset_unclaimed_rewards()] [Package Visibility Risk] Can any volo_vault module call reset_unclaimed_rewards() to drain a user's rewards maliciously, or does the calling context enforce proper checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reward_indices_mut()] [Mutable Table Access] Since reward_indices_mut() returns a mutable reference with package visibility, can a buggy module directly modify reward indices to manipulate reward calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: unclaimed_rewards_mut()] [Direct Reward Manipulation] Can unclaimed_rewards_mut() be abused by a compromised package module to directly inflate or deflate unclaimed rewards without going through update_reward()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Reentrant Status Change] If update_after_request_deposit() is called when status is already PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS, does it accumulate pending_deposit_balance without validating the previous pending operation was completed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Status Overwrite] Can calling update_after_request_withdraw() overwrite an existing PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS, allowing mixed pending operations that violate the state machine? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Premature Status Reset] Does update_after_cancel_deposit() unconditionally set status to NORMAL_STATUS even if pending_withdraw_shares is non-zero, creating an invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Missing Status Validation] Does update_after_execute_deposit() verify that status is PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS before executing, or can it be called from NORMAL_STATUS to manipulate shares? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_withdraw()] [Status Transition Without Validation] Can update_after_cancel_withdraw() be called when status is NORMAL_STATUS, causing it to underflow pending_withdraw_shares without proper state validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Final State Inconsistency] After update_after_execute_withdraw() sets status to NORMAL_STATUS, can there be residual pending_withdraw_shares or pending_deposit_balance that violate invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Auto-Transfer Status Logic] The recipient check for PENDING_WITHDRAW_WITH_AUTO_TRANSFER_STATUS uses address::from_u256(0)—can an attacker pass a crafted address that evaluates to zero but is not the intended zero address? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Deposit Accumulation] Can an attacker make multiple deposit requests without executing them to accumulate pending_deposit_balance, then execute all at once to game share pricing at a favorable vault state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Partial Cancel Exploit] If cancelled_deposit_balance is less than pending_deposit_balance, the status resets to NORMAL but pending_deposit_balance remains non-zero—can this create an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Stale Timestamp] The last_deposit_time is updated in update_after_execute_deposit()—can an attacker exploit timestamp manipulation to bypass locking windows for subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Zero Deposit Execution] Can update_after_execute_deposit() be called with executed_deposit_balance=0 and new_shares=0 to manipulate last_deposit_time without actually depositing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Full Balance Cancel] If the entire pending_deposit_balance is canceled, does this properly reset all deposit-related state, or can fragments remain that affect future operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Withdrawal Request Spam] Can an attacker make numerous small withdrawal requests to repeatedly update pending_withdraw_shares, causing gas exhaustion or state bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_withdraw()] [Cancel Without Request] Can update_after_cancel_withdraw() be called when no withdrawal was requested (pending_withdraw_shares=0), causing underflow or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Claimable Principal Accumulation] Can claimable_principal be accumulated across multiple withdrawal executions, and does this allow an attacker to bypass single-withdrawal limits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Partial Execution] If executed_withdraw_shares is less than pending_withdraw_shares, the status resets to NORMAL while pending shares remain—can this enable duplicate withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Repeated Claims] Can update_after_claim_principal() be called multiple times with small amounts to bypass single-claim limits or fee structures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Zero Amount Claim] Can amount=0 be passed to update_after_claim_principal(), and does this allow manipulating claim-related timestamps or state without actual funds transfer? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Reward Index Rollback] If the reward manager mistakenly passes a new_reward_idx lower than the previous index, update_reward() returns 0—can this cause permanent desynchronization between receipts and global reward state? (High)"
