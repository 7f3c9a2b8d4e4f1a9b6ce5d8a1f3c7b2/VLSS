  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: request_id()] [Visibility] All getter functions are public allowing external modules to read request details - could exposing request_id enable frontrunning attacks where attacker observes pending requests and executes them first if execute_deposit lacks proper authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: receipt_id()] [Visibility] The receipt_id getter is public - could external attacker enumerate all receipt_ids by querying deposit_requests Table, then target high-value receipts for attack? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: recipient()] [Visibility] The recipient getter is public - could exposing recipient addresses enable social engineering or phishing attacks against pending request owners? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: vault_id()] [Visibility] The vault_id getter is public - could attackers use this to map requests to specific vaults and identify high-value vault targets? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: amount()] [Visibility] The amount getter is public - could exposing deposit amounts enable MEV attacks where bots frontrun large deposits to exploit share price changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: expected_shares()] [Visibility] The expected_shares getter is public - could exposing expected slippage tolerance enable sandwich attacks where attacker manipulates vault value before execution to extract maximum slippage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: request_time()] [Visibility] The request_time getter is public - could exposing request creation time enable timing attacks where attacker waits for locking_time_for_cancel_request to expire then griefs by canceling victim's request? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The struct stores receipt_id and vault_id as addresses but doesn't enforce object existence - could stale requests with deleted receipt_id or vault_id cause execute_deposit to panic or behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The amount field must match coin value in deposit_coin_buffer but no cryptographic binding exists - could attacker exploit TOCTOU race by modifying coin buffer between request creation and execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The expected_shares is set at request time based on current share ratio - could vault operations between request and execution change share ratio such that expected_shares is always violated, DoSing all pending deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The struct doesn't store principal coin type - could generic type erasure in Vault<T> allow request created for Vault<CoinA> to be executed in Vault<CoinB> if vault_id check passes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Integration] The constructor doesn't validate that receipt_id corresponds to actual Receipt<T> object - could creating request with receipt_id pointing to non-Receipt object cause type confusion in vault_receipt updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Integration] The constructor is called from vault.request_deposit() which adds to deposit_requests Table - could failure after Table.add but before coin buffer add create inconsistent state with request but no coin? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The request_id is auto-incremented counter deposit_id_count - could counter overflow after u64::MAX requests cause ID collision with early requests still in buffer? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The recipient field is only checked in cancel_deposit, not execute_deposit - could operator execute deposit and transfer shares to wrong vault receipt if receipt ownership changed between request and execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] The struct is copied (*deposit_request) during execute_deposit - could modification of original request in Table after copy but before deletion enable request replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Integration] No expiration timestamp or max_execution_time field - could requests remain in buffer indefinitely, and stale requests with outdated expected_shares always fail execution causing permanent coin lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No validation that receipt_id != vault_id - could passing same address for both cause confusion in receipt lookup and vault operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No validation that recipient != address(0) - could zero recipient address be exploited if cancel_deposit uses recipient for coin transfer destination? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No validation on expected_shares upper bound - could setting expected_shares = u256::MAX cause all executions to fail slippage check (user_shares <= max_shares_received), permanently locking deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No validation that amount * deposit_fee_rate won't overflow - could large amount cause overflow in fee calculation during execute_deposit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No min_amount threshold - could dust deposits with amount = 1 cause precision loss in share calculations or waste gas? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No max_amount threshold - could depositing u64::MAX amount cause overflow in vault's total_shares calculation (total_shares + user_shares)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] No check that request_id is strictly increasing - could non-sequential request_ids break pagination or iteration logic in off-chain indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Missing Field] No slippage tolerance percentage field - how is slippage calculated and could max_shares_received parameter in execute_deposit be manipulated if it's not part of immutable request? (Medium)"
