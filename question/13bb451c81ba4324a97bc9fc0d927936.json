  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Finish Update Validation] Does vault.finish_update_asset_value validate that the usd_value is reasonable (within loss tolerance), or does it blindly accept any value including 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Asset Type String] Can the asset_type String be maliciously crafted with unicode, special characters, or excessive length to bypass validation or cause storage issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Cross-Asset Contamination] Can updating one asset's value inadvertently affect another asset's accounting due to shared state or incorrect asset_type parsing? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Market Value Consistency] Are reserve::ctoken_market_value and reserve::market_value calculated at the same block/timestamp, or can block boundaries cause inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Rate Ratio Overflow] In borrowed_amount.mul(rate_ratio), even if neither operand overflows individually, can their product overflow u256? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Accumulator Overflow] If total_deposited_value_usd approaches u256::MAX and one more market_value is added, will the overflow be caught or wrap silently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Final Division Precision] Does dividing by DECIMAL at the end lose significant precision for positions valued at less than 1e9 (< 1 USD)? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Liquidation Detection] When returning 0 for underwater positions, does this prevent proper liquidation triggers in the vault's risk management system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Health Factor Bypass] If this adaptor reports 0 value for bad positions, can it bypass health factor checks that should prevent further operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Risk Calculation] Does reporting net value (deposits - borrows) provide sufficient information for risk management, or do gross exposure amounts matter? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [to_scaled_val Semantics] What does to_scaled_val() do exactly - does it scale to 1e9, 1e18, or some other base? Is this documented and validated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Inconsistent Scaling] If deposits and borrows use different decimal scaling in their market_value calculations, will the subtraction be incorrect? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Iterator Safety] Can the do_ref! iterator macro be exited early or fail mid-loop, leaving totals partially calculated? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Compound Order] Does the order of compounding reserves matter? Can an attacker benefit by ensuring deposits compound before borrows or vice versa? (Medium)",
