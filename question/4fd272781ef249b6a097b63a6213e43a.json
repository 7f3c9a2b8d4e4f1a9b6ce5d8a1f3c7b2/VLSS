  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Sandwich Attack] Could an attacker sandwich legitimate oracle creation by front-running with creation and back-running with deletion (if deletion exists), causing DoS or confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate() + actuate()] [State Machine Confusion] If Queue has internal state machine (active/paused/migrating), could oracle creation in wrong states cause invalid state transitions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay Attack] Could OracleCreated events be replayed or duplicated to confuse off-chain systems into thinking multiple oracles were created? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Abort Cleanup] If run() aborts due to validation failure, are there any cleanup operations needed, or could partial state remain? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [ID Generation Failure] If oracle::new() fails to generate a unique ID (collision, overflow, etc.), how does this manifest - silent failure, abort, or corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Mutability] The validate() takes &Queue (immutable ref) but checks existing_oracles - could concurrent mutations between validation and actuation cause inconsistency? (High)"
