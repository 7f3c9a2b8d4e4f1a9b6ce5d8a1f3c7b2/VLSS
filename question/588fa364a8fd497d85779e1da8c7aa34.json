  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call this function with arbitrary vault and asset_type to update positions they don't own, potentially manipulating vault accounting before other operations execute? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Access Control] Does the vault.get_defi_asset() call properly validate that the caller has authorization to access the SuilendObligationOwnerCap for the specified asset_type, or can unauthorized parties trigger value updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Permission Escalation] If an attacker can control the asset_type parameter, can they access obligation caps for different assets than intended and manipulate their valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Package Visibility] Is the package visibility of parse_suilend_obligation sufficient, or could other modules in the same package misuse this to calculate obligation values without proper authorization checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Integer Overflow] In the accumulation loop for total_deposited_value_usd += market_value.to_scaled_val(), can repeated large deposits cause u256 overflow, wrapping to a small value and breaking vault accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Integer Overflow] In the accumulation loop for total_borrowed_value_usd += market_value.to_scaled_val(), can accumulated borrows overflow u256 and wrap around, showing artificially low debt? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Division by Zero] In the borrowed amount calculation new_borrowed_amount.mul(new_cumulative_borrow_rate.div(cumulative_borrow_rate)), what happens if cumulative_borrow_rate is zero? Does this cause a division by zero panic or silent failure? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Precision Loss] When dividing by DECIMAL (1e9) at line 88, does integer division cause significant precision loss for small position values, potentially undervaluing assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Arithmetic Underflow] If total_deposited_value_usd - total_borrowed_value_usd underflows due to precision errors before the comparison check, could this cause a panic instead of returning 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Rounding Error] Does the final division by DECIMAL always round down, potentially accumulating losses over many valuations that benefit borrowers over depositors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Multiplication Overflow] In new_borrowed_amount.mul(new_cumulative_borrow_rate.div(cumulative_borrow_rate)), can the multiplication overflow before division, especially with high borrow rates accumulated over time? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Stale Price] The comment states prices must be updated before calling, but the function doesn't verify this - can an attacker exploit stale prices in lending_market to inflate/deflate position values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Price Freshness] The assert_price_is_fresh(clock) checks at lines 56 and 68 validate freshness, but what if the price was updated just before expiry with a manipulated value - can this be exploited in the brief valid window? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Price Manipulation] If an attacker can manipulate Suilend reserve prices via flash loans or oracle attacks right before calling update_suilend_position_value, can they artificially inflate collateral or deflate debt values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Oracle Staleness] Does assert_price_is_fresh() have an appropriate staleness threshold, or can prices that are technically 'fresh' but significantly outdated due to rapid market moves be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Price Update Race] Can an attacker observe a price update transaction in the mempool and front-run update_suilend_position_value to exploit favorable pricing before it changes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Decimal Mismatch] If Suilend reserves use different decimal precisions than DECIMAL (1e9), could market_value.to_scaled_val() return values in unexpected scales causing massive over/under-valuation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Interest Manipulation] Can an attacker repeatedly call compound_interest on specific reserve indices to manipulate interest accrual in their favor before position valuation occurs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Cumulative Rate Manipulation] In the borrow rate calculation, if an attacker can influence cumulative_borrow_rate through Suilend operations, can they reduce their debt calculation artificially? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Stale Borrow Rate] If borrow.cumulative_borrow_rate() is stale compared to reserve::cumulative_borrow_rate(), does the ratio calculation correctly account for all accrued interest, or can borrowers avoid paying full interest? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Selective Compounding] The function compounds interest for all reserve indices in the obligation - can an attacker selectively trigger compounding only when favorable (e.g., after deposits but before borrows)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Interest Rate Edge Case] If new_cumulative_borrow_rate equals cumulative_borrow_rate (no time passed), does the division return exactly 1.0, or are there precision issues that could compound over many operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Negative Value Return] When total_borrowed_value_usd > total_deposited_value_usd, the function returns 0 - does this mask underwater positions that should trigger liquidations or loss tolerance checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Zero Collateral Attack] If all deposits are withdrawn but borrows remain, will parse_suilend_obligation return 0 instead of negative value, hiding bad debt from the vault's accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Value Update Timing] After calling finish_update_asset_value with usd_value, is there a gap where the vault's view of the position is inconsistent with Suilend's actual state? (Medium)"
