  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: decimal()] [Decimal Consistency] If two tokens have different decimals (e.g., 6 and 18), can vault calculations mixing these prices cause magnitude errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Decimal Immutability] Once registered, price.decimal cannot be changed, but if a token's economics change requiring decimal adjustment, is there a migration path? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Max Price Value] Can token_price be set to u256::MAX (2^256 - 1), and would this cause overflow in vault valuation calculations that multiply price * balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Price Volatility] Can feeder update prices with extreme volatility (e.g., 10x increase) in a single update without any validation, enabling oracle manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Price Discontinuity] Can friend modules cause price discontinuities by updating prices that differ by orders of magnitude from the previous value without sanity checks? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Clock Regression] If Sui network experiences clock regression (time goes backwards), can current_ts < price.timestamp cause staleness check to fail for fresh prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Timestamp Injection] Can feeder call update_token_price() with a Clock object from a different context to manipulate perceived update time? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Oracle ID 0] Can oracle_id = 0 be registered, and could this conflict with uninitialized or default values in consuming contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Oracle ID 255] Can oracle_id = 255 be registered without issues, or does this edge case cause problems in contracts using u8::MAX as a sentinel value? (Medium)",
