  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_config()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker obtain or forge a StorageAdminCap to create multiple flash_loan_config instances, potentially causing config collision or DoS by exhausting shared object slots? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_config()] [Resource Exhaustion] If flash_loan::create_config shares the FlashLoanConfig object, can repeated calls by the admin create unbounded shared objects leading to storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_config()] [Missing Validation] Does the function verify that a FlashLoanConfig doesn't already exist before creation, preventing duplicate configs that could cause confusion in asset lookup? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_config()] [Ownership Transfer] If flash_loan::create_config transfers ownership to sender, can an attacker front-run the admin transaction to claim ownership of the config? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Asset ID Validation] Can an attacker exploit the asset_id < reserves_count check at line 35 by creating flash loan assets for edge-case asset_id values (0 or reserves_count-1) that may not have proper pool initialization? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker pass a malicious generic type T that doesn't match storage but passes the string comparison at line 38 due to type_name manipulation or aliasing, enabling flash loans against wrong pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Rate Manipulation] Can the admin set rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury > 100% (assuming BPS) at lines 28-29, causing flash loan fee calculations to overflow or exceed borrowed amount? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Rate Manipulation] Can rate_to_supplier or rate_to_treasury be set to 0, allowing free flash loans that break the fee-collection invariant and drain protocol revenue? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Constraint Violation] Can minimum > maximum (lines 31-32) be set, causing flash_loan module to fail on all borrow attempts or accept invalid ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Constraint Violation] Can minimum be set to 0, allowing dust flash loans that could be used for griefing or gas-draining attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Constraint Violation] Can maximum be set to u64::MAX, allowing flash loans that exceed pool balance and cause revert-based DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Pool Address Validation] Is the pool_address at line 40 properly validated to ensure it points to a legitimate pool controlled by the protocol, preventing flash loans against attacker-controlled pools? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Duplicate Asset Creation] Can the same asset_id be registered multiple times in FlashLoanConfig, causing collision or allowing rate manipulation by overwriting existing settings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Storage-Pool Mismatch] If storage reports coin_type for asset_id but pool doesn't contain that type, can the mismatch cause flash loan failures or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Type String Comparison] Can type_name::into_string produce inconsistent strings for the same type across different contexts, causing false negative in type validation at line 38? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Rate Manipulation] Can _value parameter be set to an unbounded u64 value (e.g., u64::MAX) causing overflow in fee calculations during flash loan repayment? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Missing Validation] Does the function validate that rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury <= 10000 (if BPS) or reasonable bounds, preventing total fees from exceeding principal? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker call this function with type T that exists in config but has been deprecated or removed from storage, causing stale rate application? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Race Condition] Can the admin update rate_to_supplier while flash loans are active, causing mid-flight transactions to use unexpected fee rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Zero Rate Exploit] Can rate_to_supplier be set to 0, breaking supplier reward distribution and allowing free flash loans that harm liquidity providers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Rate Manipulation] Can rate_to_treasury be set to excessively high values that drain all flash loan fees to treasury, leaving suppliers with 0% yield? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Authorization Bypass] If StorageAdminCap can be duplicated or shared, can multiple actors race to set conflicting rate_to_treasury values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Missing Event Emission] Does the function emit events for rate changes? Without events, can admin maliciously change rates without user awareness? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_min()] [Constraint Manipulation] Can _value be set higher than existing max, creating an impossible constraint where min > max breaks all flash loan attempts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_min()] [DoS Attack] Can min be set to pool's total liquidity or higher, effectively disabling flash loans for that asset? (Medium)"
