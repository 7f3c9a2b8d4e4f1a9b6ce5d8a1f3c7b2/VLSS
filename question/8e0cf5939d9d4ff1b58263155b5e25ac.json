  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.expected_amount] [Negative Slippage] Does expected_amount validation allow values higher than fair share value, enabling users to grief the vault by demanding more than their shares are worth? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Time Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the clock/timestamp input to new() to set request_time in the past, immediately satisfying locking_time_for_cancel_request and canceling requests before execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Future Timestamp] Can request_time be set to far future, preventing cancellation for an extended period and locking user funds unnecessarily? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Clock Drift] If different nodes have clock drift, can request_time comparisons with clock.timestamp_ms() produce inconsistent results for locking time verification? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Timestamp Overflow] Can request_time + locking_time_for_cancel_request overflow u64 if request_time is near max value, causing underflow in comparison and bypassing time locks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Zero Timestamp] Can request_time be zero, causing arithmetic underflows when calculating elapsed time or comparing against locking periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest.request_time] [Request Ordering] Does request_time enable request reordering attacks where older requests are executed after newer ones, potentially exploiting temporal vault state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: request_id()] [Information Disclosure] Does the public request_id getter allow attackers to enumerate all withdrawal requests and analyze request patterns for front-running opportunities? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: receipt_id()] [Information Disclosure] Can the public receipt_id getter expose users' receipt addresses, enabling targeted attacks on specific high-value receipts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: recipient()] [Privacy Leakage] Does the public recipient getter leak withdrawal destination addresses, compromising user privacy and enabling transaction graph analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: vault_id()] [Information Disclosure] Can the public vault_id getter expose vault addresses that should remain private, aiding attacks on specific vault instances? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: shares()] [MEV Exploitation] Does the public shares getter enable MEV bots to calculate exact withdrawal amounts and sandwich legitimate withdrawals with their own requests? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: expected_amount()] [Front-Running] Can the public expected_amount getter reveal users' slippage tolerance, allowing attackers to front-run withdrawals by manipulating vault value just below expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: request_time()] [Timing Attack] Does the public request_time getter enable attackers to calculate exactly when requests become cancellable, allowing sniping of about-to-unlock requests? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest abilities] [Unauthorized Duplication] Since WithdrawRequest has 'copy' ability, can an attacker duplicate a legitimate request and replay it multiple times to drain excess funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest abilities] [Memory Corruption] Does the 'drop' ability allow WithdrawRequest objects to be dropped without proper cleanup, leaving orphaned shares that can never be recovered? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest abilities] [Unauthorized Storage] Can the 'store' ability be exploited to store WithdrawRequest objects in attacker-controlled data structures outside the official request buffer? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest abilities] [Copy Exploit] Can an attacker copy a WithdrawRequest, modify the vault's request buffer to remove the original, but still execute the copy, double-spending shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest abilities] [Storage Proliferation] Does the 'store' ability enable attackers to create unlimited WithdrawRequest copies in various storage locations, causing state bloat and gas DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: request_buffer] [Buffer Overflow] Can the request buffer become full if too many WithdrawRequest objects are created, causing DoS for new withdrawal requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: request_buffer] [Buffer Corruption] If WithdrawRequest objects are stored in a VecMap or Table, can key collisions corrupt the buffer when request_id wraps or duplicates occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: request_buffer] [Orphaned Requests] Can WithdrawRequest objects remain in the buffer indefinitely if execution/cancellation fails, accumulating and wasting storage space? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: request_buffer] [Race Condition] Can concurrent creation of WithdrawRequest objects cause race conditions in buffer updates, leading to inconsistent request_id increments or missing requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: request_buffer] [Access Pattern] If the request buffer allows random access by request_id, can attackers selectively execute favorable requests while ignoring unfavorable ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: vault_receipt] [Receipt Status Desync] Can a WithdrawRequest be created when receipt status is not NORMAL_STATUS, bypassing status checks if validation occurs before request creation? (High)"
