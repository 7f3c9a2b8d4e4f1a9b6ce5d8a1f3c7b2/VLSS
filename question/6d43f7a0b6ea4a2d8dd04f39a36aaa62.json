  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Withdrawal Without Split] Unlike remove_stakes(), export_stakes() doesn't use split logic and removes entire stakes, can this export more than intended if stakes are large? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Return Values] Returns (Balance, exported_count, exported_sui_amount), but how does caller verify these match expected values or detect partial exports? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Constants] [Magic Number] MIST_PER_SUI is hardcoded as 1_000_000_000, can this become incorrect if Sui denomination changes in future protocol upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Constants] [Limit Setting] MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE is set to 16, is this limit sufficient for realistic validator set management, or can it cause operational issues requiring frequent update calls? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Constants] [Error Codes] Error codes (E_NO_ACTIVE_VLDRS=300, etc.) start at 300, can conflicts with error codes in other modules cause confusion in debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: Vault] [Field Access] The 'gap' field tracks removed stakes but never decreases, can this cause the gap to grow unbounded and waste storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: Vault] [ObjectTable Storage] Stakes are stored in ObjectTable<u64, StakedSui> with u64 keys, can the key space (0 to u64::MAX) be exhausted with many add/remove cycles? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Dual Storage] Validators are stored in both 'validators' VecMap and 'sorted_validators' vector, can these become desynchronized leading to inconsistent validator sets? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [is_sorted Flag] The is_sorted flag is set by sort_validators() but never checked before operations, can functions rely on sorted order without enforcing sort first? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Table vs VecMap] Vaults use Table<address, Vault> while validators use VecMap<address, u64>, can this asymmetry cause issues when validators exist in VecMap but have no vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Events] [ValidatorsSorted Event] Emits the full validator list, can very large validator sets cause event size limits or excessive gas costs? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Events] [ValidatorPriorUpdated Event] Emitted for each validator update, but no event for stake additions/removals, can this make it difficult to audit stake flows? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Events] [Missing Events] No events for vault creation, destruction, or pruning, can this make monitoring system health difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [Overflow] In 'vault.total_staked = vault.total_staked + value', if value is u64::MAX and total_staked > 0, can overflow occur? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Underflow] In 'vault_mut_ref.total_staked = vault_mut_ref.total_staked - total_withdrawn_principal_value', can underflow occur if rewards or accounting errors make withdrawal > total_staked? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Overflow] In 'total_withdrawn_principal_value = total_withdrawn_principal_value + principal_value', can accumulated principal values overflow u64? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Underflow] In 'requested_amount - balance::value(&total_withdrawn)', can this underflow if total_withdrawn > requested_amount due to minimum withdrawal logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Underflow] In 'principal_value - rest_requested_amount >= MIST_PER_SUI', can principal_value < rest_requested_amount cause underflow before the >= check? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Overflow] In '*exported_sui_amount = *exported_sui_amount + withdrawn.value()', can accumulated values overflow u64? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Complexity] The nested while loop has O(n²) complexity for n validators, can a large validator set (approaching MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE) cause excessive gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Insertion Position] Uses 'vector::insert(&mut sorted, *vldr_address_ref, j)' to insert at position j, can incorrect j calculation cause wrong ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Break Condition] Uses 'break' when finding insertion position, but if no break occurs, validator is inserted at end, can this cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Zero Priority Handling] Validators with priority==0 are always appended at end, can this cause the sorted list to have all zero-priority validators clustered incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [Reentrancy] If StakedSui object operations can trigger external calls, can reentrancy cause duplicate stake additions before vault state is committed? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Reentrancy] The call to 'sui_system::request_withdraw_stake_non_entry()' is external, can reentrancy allow manipulation of vault state during withdrawal? (High)"
