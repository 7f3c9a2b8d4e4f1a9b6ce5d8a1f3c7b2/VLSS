  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker call execute_deposit multiple times before state updates complete, exploiting the delay between update_state_of_all and increase_supply_balance to deposit with stale indices and receive inflated scaled amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Integer Overflow] If amount parameter approaches u256::MAX, can ray_div in increase_supply_balance (line 329) cause overflow when computing scaled_amount, allowing attacker to mint unlimited supply tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Index Manipulation] Can attacker deposit immediately after update_state_of_all but before supply_index increases from interest accrual, getting more scaled tokens than deserved by exploiting timing window? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Validation Bypass] Does validate_deposit check for zero amount deposits? Can attacker spam zero-amount deposits to manipulate user_collaterals list or trigger DoS via excessive storage operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [State Inconsistency] If is_collateral returns false but storage::update_user_collaterals fails or reverts, can user have deposited funds without being tracked in collateral list, enabling loss of funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Supply Index Race] If supply_index is updated between validation and increase_supply_balance, can attacker receive incorrect scaled_amount due to index mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Interest Rate Manipulation] After deposit, update_interest_rate changes rates - can attacker immediately borrow at old rate before rate update propagates to avoid higher borrowing costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Collateral List DoS] Can attacker repeatedly add/remove same asset from collaterals list by depositing/withdrawing minimum amounts to cause storage bloat or gas griefing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Treasury Inflation] Since treasury balance increases in update_state, can attacker deposit massive amount right after state update to dilute treasury's proportional share of supply? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Rounding Error Accumulation] With small deposits using ray_div for scaled_amount calculation, can attacker exploit rounding to receive more scaled tokens than actual deposit warrants over many transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Health Check Bypass] After decrease_supply_balance but before is_health check, can attacker's collateral be externally manipulated to pass health check despite being unhealthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Tiny Balance Treasury Drain] If token_amount - actual_amount <= 1000, balance goes to treasury - can attacker intentionally create many accounts with 999 unit balances to drain protocol via forced treasury transfers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Collateral Removal Race] Between checking token_amount == actual_amount and remove_user_collaterals, can concurrent operation change balance causing incorrect collateral list state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Amount Capping Exploit] Since actual_amount = min(amount, token_amount), can attacker request u256::MAX to always withdraw full balance bypassing any intended withdrawal limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Health Factor Timing] Is health check performed with stale oracle prices? Can attacker withdraw when oracle is outdated, becoming unhealthy before prices update? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [u64 Downcasting Risk] Return value casts actual_amount from u256 to u64 - can large withdrawals overflow u64, causing returned value mismatch and fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Tiny Balance Threshold Abuse] The 1000 unit threshold for tiny balance - is this checked against raw or scaled balance? Can attacker exploit scale factor differences to avoid threshold? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [State Update Ordering] update_state_of_all called before withdraw but interest_rate updated after - can attacker exploit stale rates between these calls for arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Collateral List Corruption] If is_collateral check and remove_user_collaterals are non-atomic, can user end up with zero balance but still in collateral list or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_withdraw()] [Assert Failure DoS] If user_collateral_balance returns 0, assert at line 76 prevents withdrawal - can attacker force user balance to 0 to DoS legitimate withdrawals? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Health Factor Calculation Error] Lines 150-155 calculate health_factor_in_borrow and compare with user_health_factor - can rounding in ray_div cause incorrect comparison allowing undercollateralized borrowing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [LTV Threshold Bypass] Assert at line 152 requires avg_ltv > 0 and avg_threshold > 0, but what if avg_ltv is minimal (e.g., 1)? Can attacker borrow with negligible collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Oracle Manipulation] calculate_avg_ltv and calculate_avg_threshold use oracle prices - can attacker manipulate oracle within single transaction to inflate collateral value and over-borrow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Loan List Update Race] Between increase_borrow_balance and update_user_loans, can concurrent transaction cause loan tracking inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Division by Zero] In ray_div(avg_threshold, avg_ltv) at line 153, if avg_ltv is extremely small but non-zero, can this cause precision loss allowing unhealthy borrows? (High)"
