  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_max()] [Liquidity Drain] Can max be set to u64::MAX regardless of pool liquidity, allowing flash loans that attempt to borrow more than available balance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_max()] [Constraint Violation] Can max be set below existing min, creating impossible constraints that DoS flash loan functionality? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Amount Validation] Does the function validate that amount <= available_borrow_fee_balance before withdrawal at line 89, preventing revert-based DoS? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Reentrancy Risk] Can the public_transfer at line 91 trigger recipient's receive hook, allowing reentrancy to withdraw_borrow_fee again before state updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Type Safety] If generic T doesn't match the actual fee token type in incentive, can withdraw_borrow_fee fail or withdraw wrong token? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Multiple Withdrawals] Can the admin call this function multiple times in the same transaction to drain all fees, bypassing any per-call limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: incentive_v3_version_migrate()] [Version Rollback] Can the version check at line 95 be bypassed to downgrade incentive version, potentially re-enabling old vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: incentive_v3_version_migrate()] [Version Skipping] Can the function be called to skip intermediate versions (e.g., v1 -> v3 directly), missing critical migration logic? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: incentive_v3_version_migrate()] [State Corruption] Does version_migrate at line 97 properly handle all state fields, or can partial migration leave incentive in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: incentive_v3_version_migrate()] [Missing Validation] Does the function validate that incentive is not actively distributing rewards during migration, preventing mid-distribution version changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Cap Validation] Can IncentiveOwnerCap be forged, duplicated, or transferred to unauthorized parties to create reward funds for malicious tokens? (Critical)",
