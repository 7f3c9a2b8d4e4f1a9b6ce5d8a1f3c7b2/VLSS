  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Authorization Bypass] The function lacks any authorization check allowing any user to create lending markets with arbitrary type parameters. Could an attacker create malicious lending markets that mimic legitimate ones, leading to user fund misdirection or phishing attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Missing Access Control] Since create_lending_market is a public function with no caller validation, can multiple malicious actors create competing lending markets for the same asset type, causing market fragmentation and liquidity splitting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Permissionless Creation] Without admin or operator cap checks, could an attacker create a lending market with a type parameter matching a legitimate protocol but with malicious logic, enabling rug-pull scenarios? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization Security] The init function shares the Registry as a shared object without any subsequent access control setup. Could this allow immediate exploitation by attackers who front-run legitimate market creation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Rate Limiting] The function has no rate limiting or cooldown period. Could an attacker spam the registry with thousands of lending market creations, causing DoS or state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type Parameter Collision] The table key is derived from type_name::get<P>(). If two different type parameters resolve to the same TypeName due to Move's type system edge cases, could this cause market ID collision and registry corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Phantom Type Manipulation] Since P is a phantom type parameter, could an attacker use witness patterns or type witnesses to create lending markets that bypass expected type constraints? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Generic Type Abuse] Could an attacker use nested generic types or complex type parameters to create TypeName entries that collide with or shadow legitimate market entries in the table? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type System Edge Case] If Move allows parametric types with different concrete instantiations to resolve to similar TypeNames, could this enable duplicate market creation despite the table uniqueness constraint? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Module Aliasing Attack] If an attacker deploys a module with the same name but different package ID, could the TypeName representation cause confusion or enable market hijacking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Duplicate Market Check] The table::add call will abort if the TypeName already exists, but there's no check before calling lending_market::create_lending_market. Could this cause resource wastage where a LendingMarket is created but registration fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Partial State Update] If table::add fails after lending_market::create_lending_market succeeds, the LendingMarket and OwnerCap are returned but not registered. Could these orphaned objects be exploited if they retain functionality? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Missing Market Removal] There's no function to remove markets from the registry. If a market becomes obsolete or compromised, could it remain registered indefinitely, enabling continued exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Registry Growth Unbounded] The lending_markets table can grow without limit. Could an attacker create enough markets to cause storage exhaustion or make table lookups prohibitively expensive? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Integrity] The Registry's lending_markets table maps TypeName to ID, but there's no validation that the ID corresponds to an actual LendingMarket object. Could stale or incorrect IDs persist after market deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Check Bypass] The version check only compares against CURRENT_VERSION (1). If a registry upgrade increases CURRENT_VERSION, could old registry objects become permanently unusable without migration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Downgrade Attack] If an attacker could somehow modify registry.version to a lower value, could they bypass future version checks and exploit deprecated code paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Constant: CURRENT_VERSION] [Version Immutability] CURRENT_VERSION is hardcoded to 1. Without upgrade logic, how can the protocol handle breaking changes without breaking existing registries? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Mismatch DoS] An attacker could monitor for registry upgrades and immediately create lending markets, causing all subsequent creates to fail with EIncorrectVersion if version checking is too strict. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Error: EIncorrectVersion] [Version Error Handling] The error code is generic. Could insufficient error context make debugging version mismatch issues difficult in production, leading to prolonged service disruption? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Storage Only] The registry only stores the LendingMarket's ID but returns the actual object. If the market is later deleted or transferred, could the registry contain dangling ID references? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No ID Verification] After calling lending_market::create_lending_market, there's no verification that the returned object's ID matches what's being stored. Could a malicious lending_market module return mismatched IDs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Lookup Limitation] The registry provides no lookup function. How can users verify which ID corresponds to which type, and could this lack of transparency enable phishing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Immutability] Once an ID is registered for a TypeName, it can never be updated. If the associated LendingMarket is compromised, could users still be directed to the malicious market? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Shared Object Race] The Registry is shared immediately after creation. Could multiple actors race to create the first market for a given type, with the winner getting permanent control? (Medium)"
