  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call this public function directly without operator/admin caps to manipulate asset valuations, bypassing vault operation status checks, enabling unauthorized value updates during critical operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the function verify that the caller has proper operator capabilities before allowing position value updates, or can any external party trigger value recalculations to cause DoS or manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Access Control] Can an attacker pass a malicious vault reference to update values for positions they don't own, potentially corrupting accounting in other users' vaults? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Access Control] Since this is a public function, can external contracts call it with manipulated pool/position references to extract sensitive pricing information or cause computational DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Authorization] Is there validation that the asset_type string corresponds to an actual Momentum position in the vault, or can attackers pass arbitrary strings to create ghost assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Switchboard oracle price feed to pass the slippage check while still providing incorrect relative_price_from_oracle, enabling price oracle attacks during position valuation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Staleness] Does the function verify oracle price freshness before using price_a and price_b in calculations, or can stale prices from hours/days ago pass validation and corrupt position values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] If price_b is manipulated to be very small (near zero), can the division price_a * DECIMAL / price_b cause overflow in relative_price_from_oracle calculation at line 51? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Bypass] Can an attacker set dex_slippage() to 10000 (100%) in config to bypass the price sanity check entirely, allowing arbitrary pool manipulation to pass validation? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Precision] When calculating relative_price_from_oracle with price_a * DECIMAL / price_b, can precision loss for low-value tokens cause the slippage check to incorrectly pass/fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Attack] Can an attacker exploit the diff() calculation by manipulating pool_price to be exactly equal to relative_price_from_oracle * (1 + slippage threshold - epsilon), passing validation with maximum deviation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Double Oracle Call] Are normalized_price_a and normalized_price_b guaranteed to be from the same oracle update as price_a and price_b, or can oracle updates between calls cause price inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Decimals] Can mismatched decimals between oracle price (18 decimals) and coin decimals cause the relative price calculation to be incorrect if coins have extreme decimal values (e.g., 0 or 18)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Bypass] Can the slippage check be bypassed if relative_price_from_oracle is zero, causing division by zero or assertion bypass in the comparison logic? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Logic] Does diff() return absolute value, and can negative price differences bypass the slippage check if diff() returns signed values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Threshold] If slippage from config.dex_slippage() can be set to 0, will all position updates fail due to ERR_INVALID_POOL_PRICE, causing DoS? (High)",
