  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Function: FlashLoanMultiple()] [Cross-Asset Flash Loans] If FlashLoanMultiple() is used across assets with different decimal precisions (e.g., 6 vs 9 decimals), can this cause some assets to have effectively zero flash loan fees?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Function: percentage_benchmark()] [Cross-Module Inconsistency] If Volo Vault uses different percentage precision than lending_core's 10000, can this cause fee calculation mismatches when vault operations interact with lending pools?
