  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Value Addition Overflow] When computing 'value_a + value_b', can this overflow u256 for extremely large positions, causing incorrect total USD value to be stored in vault? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Sqrt Price Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate pool.sqrt_price() through large swaps immediately before this call, causing amount calculations to reflect temporary prices rather than fair value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Tick Range Manipulation] If position.tick_lower_index() or tick_upper_index() are at extreme values, can this cause tick_math::get_sqrt_price_at_tick() to overflow/underflow or return invalid sqrt prices?

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Round Down Flag] The function passes 'false' as the round_down parameter to get_amounts_for_liquidity - does this always round amounts up, potentially overvaluing positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Amount Precision Loss] Can the liquidity_math calculation lose precision for small liquidity values or extreme tick ranges, returning 0 amounts when actual value exists? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: sqrt_price_x64_to_price()] [Negative Decimal Handling] The function uses if/else for decimals_a > decimals_b, but if they're equal, does it return price_u256_with_decimals unmodified, and is this correct? (Low)",
