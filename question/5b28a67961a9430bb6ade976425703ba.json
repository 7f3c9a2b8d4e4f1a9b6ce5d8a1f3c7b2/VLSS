  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Executor vs Liquidate User] executor address at line 417 deposits debt and receives collateral, but liquidate_user at line 418 is the victim - can executor liquidate themselves to bypass liquidation bonus calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Treasury Calculation] Line 442-443 deposits treasury_amount to collateral_pool treasury - if normal_treasury_amount calculation in execute_liquidate has rounding error, can treasury accumulate less than intended fees over many liquidations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Excess Amount Attack] If normal_excess_amount at line 429 is greater than normal_debt_amount at line 426, executor receives back more debt tokens than deposited at line 424 - can this occur due to logic error in execute_liquidate? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Obtainable Amount Bounds] No check that obtainable_amount at line 446 doesn't exceed liquidate_user's collateral balance - can execute_liquidate return inflated obtainable_amount causing pool::withdraw_balance at line 447 to drain pool beyond user's actual collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: liquidation()] [Return Value Swap] Line 374 returns (_bonus_balance, _excess_balance) but base_liquidation_call returns (excess_balance, obtainable_balance) at line 471 - is this intentional swap, and can callers misinterpret which balance is which? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: liquidation_non_entry()] [Balance Ownership] liquidation_non_entry at line 377 accepts debt_balance directly instead of Coin - who owns this balance and can attacker pass arbitrary balance object not backed by real coins? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Event Arithmetic] Line 468 emits debt_amount - excess_amount, but if excess_amount > debt_amount due to bug, this underflows - are events unchecked allowing silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_liquidation_call()] [Collateral Amount Event] Line 464 emits obtainable_amount + treasury_amount as collateral_amount, but these are computed independently via unnormal_amount - can rounding cause sum to differ from actual collateral seized? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_with_account_cap()] [Account Owner Confusion] Line 491 uses account::account_owner(account_cap) as user for deposit, but no verification that account_cap hasn't been transferred - can attacker deposit to original owner's account after cap is sold/transferred? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: withdraw_with_account_cap()] [Unauthorized Withdrawal] Line 503 allows withdrawal using account_cap without checking current cap holder matches account_owner - if account_cap is transferred, can new holder withdraw original owner's funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: borrow_with_account_cap()] [Borrow Authority] Line 515 permits borrow via account_cap - if cap is stolen or transferred, can attacker borrow against victim's collateral and send funds to attacker's address? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: repay_with_account_cap()] [Repay on Behalf] Line 527 allows anyone with account_cap to repay the cap owner's debt - can this be used to grief by repaying unwanted debt, or to manipulate user's position health? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: create_account()] [Account Cap Uniqueness] Line 475-476 creates AccountCap via account::create_account_cap, but no check for duplicate caps per user - can user create multiple caps and use them for double-spending attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: delete_account()] [Cap Deletion DoS] Line 479-480 aborts on delete_account - if account caps cannot be deleted, do they accumulate unbounded in storage, and can this prevent account closure causing denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_flash_loan()] [Flash Loan No Fee Check] Line 531-532 calls flash_loan::loan without visible fee calculation in this function - can attacker take flash loans repeatedly without paying fees if fee is not enforced in flash_loan module? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_flash_repay()] [Receipt Validation] Line 535-536 accepts FlashLoanReceipt but no validation that receipt matches the pool being repaid - can attacker use receipt from different pool to repay and bypass fee payment? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: flash_loan_with_ctx()] [User Attribution] Line 540 uses tx_context::sender as user, but base_flash_loan takes user param - if sender is contract, can contract take flash loans on behalf of arbitrary users to bypass per-user limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: flash_loan_with_account_cap()] [Cap Flash Loan] Line 544 allows flash loans via account_cap - can cap holder take unlimited flash loans without owner's approval if cap was transferred? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: flash_repay_with_ctx()] [Repay User Mismatch] Line 548 uses tx_context::sender for repay but flash_loan might have used different user - if sender differs, does repay credit correct user? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: flash_repay_with_account_cap()] [Cross-Account Repay] Line 552 allows repaying flash loan with account_cap, but loan might have been taken by different user - can this lead to debt assignment to wrong account? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_flash_repay()] [Repay Balance Validation] Line 536 accepts repay_balance but doesn't verify amount covers loan + fee - if balance is insufficient, does flash_loan::repay revert cleanly or leave partial state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_flash_loan()] [Pool Drain] Line 532 withdraws 'amount' from pool - if amount equals total pool liquidity, does this leave pool empty for other users' withdrawals, causing cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_on_behalf_of_user()] [Unauthorized Deposit] Line 555-565 allows depositing to arbitrary user address without user's permission - can attacker grief by depositing small amounts to many users, inflating storage costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_on_behalf_of_user()] [Event Sender Tracking] Line 561 emits DepositOnBehalfOfEvent with sender and user - if sender is malicious contract, can it manipulate event logs to hide deposit origin? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: repay_on_behalf_of_user()] [Forced Repayment] Line 567-580 permits repaying another user's debt without permission - can this be used to manipulate user's collateral ratio to prevent liquidation by allies, or to waste attacker's capital? (Low)"
