  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Atomicity] If this_version() is called multiple times in a transaction, can non-atomic reads of constants::version() cause inconsistent version values within the same operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Calculation Timing] If next_version() is used to pre-allocate storage for v3 before v2->v3 migration starts, can the calculation be stale if constants::version() updates during the migration window? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Version Monotonicity] Is there enforcement that version numbers only increase monotonically, or can constants::version() decrease causing rollback scenarios that violate upgrade invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Edge Cases] Are there tests verifying behavior when constants::version() returns 0, causing next_version() to return 1 - can this break assumptions in migration code expecting version>=2? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Fuzz Testing] Has pre_check_version() been fuzz tested with random u64 inputs including 0, u64::MAX, and version±1 to ensure robust error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Integration Tests] Are there tests verifying that all modules using version checks (oracle, config, flash_loan, incentive, storage) correctly handle version mismatch scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Upgrade Coordination] If constants::version() is updated before all oracle/config objects are migrated, can users interact with unmigrated objects triggering pre_check_version() failures and temporary DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Migration Window] During the time window when some oracles are v1 and some are v2, can this_version() returning 2 cause v1 oracles to be permanently inaccessible until manual migration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Rollback Safety] If a v2->v3 upgrade fails and must be rolled back, can changing constants::version() from 3 to 2 leave v3 oracle objects in an invalid state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Emergency Stop] Is there a mechanism to disable version checks during emergency situations, or will pre_check_version() continue blocking operations even during critical incidents? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [MEV Opportunity] Can bots monitor next_version() to front-run protocol upgrades, extracting value by knowing when version checks will start failing for unmigrated users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Gas Costs] Does calling this_version() in every operation add unnecessary gas overhead compared to caching the version value in each oracle/config object? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Constants Module Risk] If oracle_constants module is compromised and version() returns malicious values, can it brick the entire oracle system by making all pre_check_version() calls fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Error Module Risk] If oracle_error::incorrect_version() is changed to return a different error code, can error handling in caller modules fail to catch version mismatch errors? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Oracle.move Risk] In oracle.move's set_update_interval(), if version_verification() using pre_check_version() aborts, can admin be locked out of updating critical oracle parameters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Config.move Risk] In config.move's version_migrate(), if this_version() returns wrong value due to race condition, can cfg.version be set incorrectly breaking all future operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Flash Loan Risk] In flash_loan.move, if pre_check_version() is missing from loan initiation but present in repayment, can version-mismatched loans be created but never repaid? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Hardcoded v2] Since constants::version() returns hardcoded 2, can upgrading to v3 require recompiling all modules, making hot upgrades impossible? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Version Semantics] Is version 2 a breaking change from v1 requiring data migration, or just a patch - can pre_check_version() incorrectly reject compatible v1 operations? (Medium)",
