  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_decimal()] [Decimal Unpacking] Can the decimal::unpack() function return invalid (value, neg) pairs that bypass validation, allowing incorrect oracle price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_decimal()] [Price Manipulation] Can an attacker craft Decimal values with specific mantissa/exponent combinations that hash identically but represent different prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_decimal()] [Copy vs Reference] Since Decimal is passed by reference but unpacked with copy (*value), could this create issues with large decimal structures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_decimal_le()] [Oracle Price Format] Does the little-endian decimal encoding exactly match Switchboard's off-chain format, or could precision loss during conversion allow stale prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_decimal_le()] [Negative Zero] Can negative zero decimals (neg=true, value=0) hash differently from positive zero, creating oracle signature rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_bytes()] [Buffer Injection] Can an attacker inject arbitrary bytes that collide with legitimate encoded integers/decimals, forging oracle signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_bytes()] [Length Prefix Missing] Since push_bytes doesn't prepend length information, can variable-length fields create ambiguous message parsing where bytes from one field bleed into another? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_bytes()] [Empty Vector Handling] Does pushing an empty vector create any hash state changes, or are empty fields silently ignored, potentially causing verification mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_bytes()] [Vector Ownership] Does append() consume the bytes vector or copy it, and could this affect subsequent operations if the caller expects to reuse the vector? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Queue Key Validation] The assertion checks queue_key.length() == 32, but can an attacker pass a valid-length key with all zeros or invalid data to bypass access control? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Feed Hash Collision] Can two different oracle feeds with colliding 32-byte hashes cause cross-feed signature replay, allowing price manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Slothash Zero Value] The test uses all-zero slothash, indicating it's optional; can attacker omit slothash verification by passing zeros to bypass Solana slot validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Max Variance Overflow] If max_variance is set to MAX_U64, can subsequent operations overflow when computing acceptable price ranges, allowing out-of-bound prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Min Responses Underflow] Can min_responses=0 be used to accept oracle updates with no actual responses, creating unverified price data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can attacker use future timestamps to make oracle updates appear fresher than reality, bypassing staleness checks in consuming contracts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Message Field Order] Does the specific order (queue_key, feed_hash, value, slothash, max_variance, min_responses, timestamp) match off-chain implementations exactly, or could reordering cause verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Value Decimal Precision] Can the push_decimal_le call lose precision for very large or very small decimal values, causing hash mismatches with off-chain signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Buffer Return via Destructuring] The function destructures Hasher to return buffer directly; could this pattern accidentally expose internal state or cause memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Length Assertion Bypass] Can an attacker pass vectors with length > 32 that are then truncated, allowing them to bypass the length assertions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Parameter Injection] Can null bytes or special characters in the 32-byte keys cause parsing errors when the message is verified off-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Oracle Key Forgery] Can an attacker register a malicious oracle by crafting an oracle_key that collides with a legitimate oracle's key hash? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Secp256k1 Key Length] The assertion checks for exactly 64 bytes, but can attacker pass compressed or uncompressed public keys interchangeably to cause verification confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Queue Authorization] Does the function verify that oracle_key is authorized for the given queue_key, or can rogue oracles attest for queues they shouldn't access? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Timestamp Replay] Can old attestation messages be replayed if timestamp validation is insufficient in the calling contract, allowing expired oracles to continue operating?
