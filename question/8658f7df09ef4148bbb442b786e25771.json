  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Upgrade Coordination] If VERSION is changed from 2 to 1 (downgrade), does migrate_version()'s <= check allow this, potentially breaking upgrade assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: current_version()] [Immutability] Since current_version() returns hardcoded VERSION constant, can discrepancies between deployed code versions cause version confusion across deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Idempotency] Can migrate_version() be safely called multiple times, and does this enable version pinning attacks where version is repeatedly set to VERSION? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Incomplete Migration] Does migrate_version() only update version field without migrating other state, potentially leaving pools in inconsistent state after version changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Field: paused] [Boolean Logic] Can paused field be manipulated through struct field access if Manage is exposed without proper encapsulation in parent modules? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Field: version] [Integer Manipulation] Can version field be directly modified if Manage struct is improperly exposed, bypassing migrate_version() validation? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Abilities] Has 'store' ability but not 'key', 'copy', or 'drop' - can this cause issues when trying to destroy or clone Manage instances in parent modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Reentrancy] Can set_paused() be called reentrantly through cross-module calls, enabling pause state manipulation during sensitive operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Reentrancy] Can migrate_version() be reentered while version field is being updated, causing version field corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between check_version() and subsequent operation if migrate_version() can be called concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [TOCTOU] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability between check_not_paused() and operation execution if set_paused() can be called concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Edge Case: version=0] If self.version is somehow 0, does migrate_version() correctly handle this edge case with <= VERSION check? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Edge Case: version=u64::MAX] If self.version is u64::MAX, can this cause arithmetic issues in <= comparison or future version math? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Edge Case: VERSION=0] If VERSION constant is 0, does this break version checking logic or enable bypass attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Edge Case: Uninitialized] If Manage struct is somehow created without calling new(), can version=0 cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Level] [Deployment Order] If manage.move is deployed after stake_pool.move, can version mismatches occur during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Multiple Instances] Can multiple Manage instances be created with different version/pause states, and does this violate singleton assumptions in parent modules? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Deployment Mismatch] If VERSION constant differs between deployed bytecode and source code, how is this detected and mitigated? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Missing Capability] Does set_paused() having package visibility without capability requirement enable privilege escalation if any package module is compromised? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Missing Capability] Does migrate_version() having package visibility without capability requirement enable unauthorized version changes from any package module? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Public Functions] [Information Disclosure] Do public functions check_version() and check_not_paused() expose internal state that could be used for timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: current_version()] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing current_version() publicly enable attackers to identify vulnerable versions for targeted exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Invariant: version<=VERSION] Is the invariant that self.version should always be <= VERSION properly maintained across all state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Invariant Violation] Can migrate_version() be called when VERSION < self.version, violating the upgrade-only assumption? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [State Transition] Are all possible state transitions for paused field (false->true, true->false, true->true, false->false) handled correctly? (Low)"
