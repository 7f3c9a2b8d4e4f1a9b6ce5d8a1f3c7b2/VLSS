  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: current_version()] [Test Abuse] Can test code set VERSION to arbitrary values and if accidentally deployed to mainnet, does this bypass all version checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Test Init] If test code creates Manage with paused=false for easier testing, can this test-only change accidentally be deployed, removing safety default? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Liquidity Trap] Can admin pause pool when LST price is high, trapping users until price drops, then unpause for admin to buy cheap LST? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Migration Frontrun] Can whales who learn about impending migration unstake before it happens to avoid any migration-related losses or risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Volo Vault] Does Volo Vault adapter check StakePool version before depositing LST, or can version mismatch cause vault to accept deprecated LST tokens? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Vault Lockup] If StakePool is paused while Volo Vault holds LST, can vault users withdraw their shares when underlying LST is frozen? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Metadata Sync] Does CERT metadata track version separately, and can desync between StakePool version and Metadata version enable double-spend via mismatched mint/burn operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Mint Bypass] Can metadata.mint() be called directly bypassing check_not_paused() in stake(), creating unbacked LST supply? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Concurrent Calls] If two admins simultaneously call migrate_version() from different transactions, can double-migration occur or cause state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Toggle Spam] Can rapid pause/unpause toggling disrupt validator delegation flows or cause accounting errors in epoch reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Assert Panic] Does assert! in check_version() cause entire transaction to revert cleanly, or can partial state changes before the check persist? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Assert Order] If check_version() is called after check_not_paused() in some functions, can wrong version code run in paused state before version check catches it? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Version Rollback] Can a malicious package upgrade set self.version to 0 and VERSION to 1, effectively rolling back to pre-v2 vulnerable state? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Multiple Pools] Can multiple StakePool instances coexist with different Manage versions, and does this create arbitrage opportunities or confusion about canonical pool? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Extra Fields] Does migration account for extra_fields bag contents, or can bag data from old version become incompatible with new version code? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Emergency Response] If a critical vulnerability is found, can admin pause fast enough before attackers drain funds, or does transaction ordering allow front-running? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Client Library] Do off-chain SDKs enforce version checks before submitting transactions, or can outdated clients bypass on-chain version checks via crafted inputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constants: VERSION] [Hardcoded] Is VERSION=2 hardcoded in multiple files, and if one file is updated but others aren't, can this create version inconsistency across modules? (High)"
