  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: EnableFeeRateEvent] [No Time Lock] Fee rate changes are immediate (no event has timestamp). Could instant changes catch users in bad positions without warning? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Delay] No time delay mechanism exists between fee rate announcement and activation. Could this enable governance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Multi-Sig] No multi-signature requirement for critical config changes. Could single compromised key modify all fee rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: init()] [No Ownership Transfer] No function to transfer GlobalConfig ownership. If admin key is lost, could protocol config become immutable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Pause Function] No emergency pause mechanism for fee rate changes. Could this prevent response to discovered vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Emergency Shutdown] If GlobalConfig is corrupted, no way to emergency shutdown. Could corrupted state persist indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Minimum Fee] No minimum fee rate enforced. Could fee_rate = 1 (0.0001% if denominator 1e6) cause rounding to zero fees? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Maximum Fee] No maximum fee enforced. Could fee_rate = u64::MAX cause overflow in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Minimum Tick Spacing] Could tick_spacing = 1 cause gas exhaustion when iterating through many ticks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Maximum Tick Spacing] Could tick_spacing = u32::MAX make liquidity ranges so coarse that precise pricing is impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Version Skew] If create_pool uses newer GlobalConfig but volo vault uses older version, could incompatibility cause asset loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [ABI Compatibility] If GlobalConfig struct layout changes, could existing pools reading old layout misinterpret fee data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [External Protocol] If external protocols rely on GlobalConfig's fee rates for their logic, could fee changes break external integrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Read Reentrancy] Could external contract call contains_fee_rate() within callback, reading intermediate state during fee update? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Flash Update] Could attacker use flash loan to create pool, modify GlobalConfig, then use pool in same transaction exploiting config change? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Atomic Arbitrage] Could attacker atomically add fee rate, create pool, swap, remove fee rate, profiting from temporary config? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Dead Code] All functions abort (dead code). Could this indicate abandoned/deprecated module still in dependency tree? (High)"
