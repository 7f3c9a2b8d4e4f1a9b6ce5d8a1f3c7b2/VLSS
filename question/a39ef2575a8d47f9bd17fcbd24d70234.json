  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [PTB Revert] If a PTB contains run() followed by other transactions that abort, will the oracle creation be rolled back, or can it succeed independently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [PTB Read] Within a PTB, if Queue is modified before validate() is called, will validate() see the updated state or stale state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Key Ownership] The oracle_key is provided by the caller - can a malicious actor register oracle keys they don't own, potentially front-running legitimate oracle operators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Key Binding] The oracle_key is bound to the created oracle at line 34 and stored in the queue at line 39 - can these keys diverge if oracle_key is modified mid-execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Key Uniqueness] The existing_oracles table uses oracle_key as the unique key - can byte-equivalent but semantically different keys (e.g., compressed vs uncompressed secp256k1 pubkeys) cause confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle-Queue Sync] The oracle stores queue.id() and queue.queue_key() at lines 35-36 - if these values change in Queue after oracle creation, will the oracle have stale references? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Bidirectional Linking] The Queue stores oracle_id in existing_oracles, and Oracle stores queue in its struct - can this bidirectional link become inconsistent if either side is modified independently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validation Staleness] The validate() call at line 55-57 reads Queue state - can this state become stale by the time actuate() mutates it at line 59-63? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running] Since run() is permissionless, can a front-runner observe a pending oracle creation transaction and register the same oracle_key first, causing the original transaction to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [MEV Extraction] Can validators/block producers see oracle_key in mempool and front-run oracle creation to claim valuable oracle positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly check existing_oracles_contains to detect when a specific oracle_key becomes available and immediately register it? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Gas Cost] The table lookup at line 25 has O(1) expected but O(n) worst-case gas cost - can hash collision attacks make oracle validation prohibitively expensive? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Gas Complexity] The actuate function performs object creation (expensive), table insertion, and event emission - can cumulative gas costs prevent oracle creation even with sufficient balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Estimation] The entry function's gas cost depends on Queue state (table size) - can users accurately estimate gas before calling run()? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Upgrade Path] When Queue upgrades from version 1 to version 2, will all existing oracle_init_action calls fail until the module is upgraded? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Migration] Is there a migration function to register oracles on upgraded queues, or must users wait for oracle_init_action to be upgraded? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Module: oracle_init_action] [Package Upgrade] If the switchboard package is upgraded, can old versions of oracle_init_action still interact with new Queue/Oracle structs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Removal Path] The module only creates oracles (add_existing_oracle) but has no removal function - can removed oracles (if Queue has removal logic) leave orphaned entries in existing_oracles? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Lifecycle Management] Once an oracle is added to existing_oracles, is there a path to remove it if the oracle becomes invalid or malicious? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Storage Cleanup] If oracle::new creates a shared Oracle but the transaction fails after, is the shared object automatically cleaned up, or does it remain in global storage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Sequence] The OracleCreated event is emitted after add_existing_oracle - can event indexers race with direct Queue queries and see inconsistent oracle sets? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Struct: OracleCreated] [Event Replay] The event has copy+drop - can events be replayed or duplicated by malicious indexers to confuse off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Reliability] If event emission at line 47 somehow fails (e.g., event limit reached), will the transaction succeed without event, causing off-chain oracle tracking to diverge? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Import: switchboard::queue] [Dependency Risk] The module depends on Queue's public API - can changes to queue.move break oracle_init_action without compile-time detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Import: switchboard::oracle] [Dependency Risk] The oracle::new call expects specific behavior - can oracle.move changes cause oracle_init_action to create invalid oracles? (High)"
