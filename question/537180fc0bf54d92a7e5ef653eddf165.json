  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Struct: Queue] [Table Memory Leak] If oracles are added but never removed, does the existing_oracles table grow unbounded causing state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: existing_oracles()] [Table Reference Exposure] Does returning &Table<vector<u8>, ExistingOracle> allow read-only access, or could callers exploit internal table structure? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Const: VERSION] [Version Check Missing] VERSION is set to 1 but there's no version validation logic - can old/incompatible code interact with queues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: version()] [Version Immutability] Queue version is set at creation and never updated - how will queue upgrades handle version migration? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Struct: Queue] [No Migration Path] There's no function to upgrade queue version or migrate data - are queues locked to VERSION=1 forever? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: queue_key()] [Key Encoding] queue_key returns vector<u8> - is there a standardized encoding format? Can different encodings cause off-chain/on-chain mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Struct: ExistingOracle] [ID Validation] oracle_id is type ID - is there any validation that this ID corresponds to an actual oracle object on-chain? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: id()] [ID Exposure] Does exposing queue.id.to_inner() allow attackers to predict or manipulate queue IDs? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Fee Manipulation Economics] Can authority repeatedly change fee between 0 and high values to extract maximum fees from ongoing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Function: set_configs()] [Oracle Griefing] Can min_attestations be set to an impossibly high number (e.g., 1000000) making oracle consensus impossible? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/queue.move] [Struct: Queue] [Fee Recipient Centralization] Single fee_recipient address creates centralization - can this address be a contract that redistributes fees maliciously? (Low)",
