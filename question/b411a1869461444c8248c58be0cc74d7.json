  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Claimed Reward Overflow] Can user_claimed_reward be manipulated to overflow and become larger than user_total_reward, causing all claimable rewards to be permanently locked at zero? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Initial User Index] If a new user's index starts at zero while global_index is already large, will user_index_diff be massive on first interaction, giving undeserved rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Storage Reference Safety] Since storage is passed as mutable reference but not modified in this function, can another function modify storage concurrently if Move's borrow checker doesn't prevent it, leading to inconsistent reads? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Incentive Immutability] The incentive parameter is immutable reference, but can its underlying data structures be modified through interior mutability patterns, causing TOCTOU issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rule Immutability] Rule is passed as immutable reference, but can rule parameters (rate, last_update_at) be stale if they were updated after this reference was taken? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Option Type Validation] If option is neither supply nor borrow (lines 75-80), the function aborts with code 0, but can this leave the system in inconsistent state if called from other functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Option Type Consistency] The same option type check is repeated at lines 95-100, but can option type change between calculate_global_index and calculate_user_reward calls within same transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Type Name String Comparison] Using string comparison for type checking at line 70 is vulnerable to type name spoofing - can an attacker create a type with identical string representation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [incentive_v3 Module Trust] The function heavily relies on incentive_v3 module functions (pools, get_pool_info, get_rule_info, etc.) - can vulnerabilities in incentive_v3 module propagate to this function? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Storage Module Trust] The function calls incentive_v3::get_effective_balance(storage, ...) - can malicious storage implementation return manipulated balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [ray_math Dependency] The function uses ray_math::ray_mul - can bugs in ray_math library cause incorrect reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Clock Dependency] The function relies on clock::timestamp_ms - can malicious or incorrect clock implementation return invalid timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Duration Casting] Duration is cast from u64 to u256 at line 88 - can this cause issues if duration is at u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Precision] If rate is very small and duration is short, can (rate * duration) / total_balance always equal zero, preventing reward accrual for users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Total Balance Manipulation] Can total_supply or total_borrow be temporarily inflated to reduce index_increased per line 88, allowing early stakers to capture disproportionate rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Partial Claims] If user claims some rewards but not all, will the next call to this function correctly account for partial claims or will it double-count unclaimed rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Claim Ordering] Since multiple rules can apply to same asset, does the order of returned rewards matter for claiming, and can attackers exploit ordering to claim specific high-value rewards first? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Rule Deactivation] If a rule is deactivated or removed after user accrues rewards but before claiming, will this function still return those rewards or are they lost? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [User Address Verification] The function accepts user address as parameter without verification - can an attacker query rewards for other users and use this information to front-run their claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Public Function Risk] This function is public and performs verification but doesn't modify state - can it be used as oracle by other contracts in unintended ways? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Internal Function Safety] This is an internal function but can it be indirectly exploited through public functions that call it with manipulated parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [vec_map Consistency] The function iterates over vec_map using keys - can concurrent modifications to vec_map cause iteration to skip entries or double-process entries? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Pool Key Integrity] Pool keys are retrieved at line 22 and popped at line 24 - can pool_key be invalid by the time it's used to access the pool at line 25? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Rule Key Existence] The function directly accesses vec_map with rule_id at line 67 - can this panic if rule_id doesn't exist, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Zero Duration Handling] When duration is exactly zero at line 85, index_increased is zero - can this be exploited to pause reward accrual by repeatedly calling with same timestamp? (Medium)"
