  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Event Accuracy] Emits AssetPriceUpdated with current_price, but what if the update partially fails - can events reflect incorrect state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Missing Bounds] No validation that current_price is within reasonable bounds (non-zero, not extreme) - can zero or MAX_U256 prices be set? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Asset Type Validation] Doesn't validate asset_type before accessing aggregators[asset_type] - can this panic for non-existent types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Clock Manipulation] Uses clock.timestamp_ms() directly - can clock rollbacks or fast-forwards manipulate price update timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Staleness Logic Bug] The condition if (now >= max_timestamp) only checks staleness if now >= max_timestamp, but what if max_timestamp > now? Is the price accepted as fresh? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Integer Overflow] now - max_timestamp can overflow if max_timestamp > now due to clock manipulation - can this bypass the staleness check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Switchboard Trust] Directly casts aggregator.current_result().result().value() to u256 without validation - can Switchboard return invalid values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Missing Error Handling] If current_result() fails or returns invalid data, the function will panic - can this be weaponized for DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Type Cast Safety] Casts result().value() as u256 without checking bounds - can overflow occur if value is negative or exceeds u256? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Timestamp Source] Uses max_timestamp_ms() from Switchboard - can manipulated Switchboard data provide future timestamps that bypass staleness checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Missing Version Check] Doesn't call check_version() before accessing config.update_interval - can this be called on unupgraded configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init()] [Single Call Assumption] init() creates and shares OracleConfig, but Move doesn't prevent multiple init() calls - can multiple OracleConfig objects exist, causing confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init()] [Default Values] Initializes with MAX_UPDATE_INTERVAL (60s) and DEFAULT_DEX_SLIPPAGE (1%) - are these safe defaults for mainnet deployment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init()] [Shared Object] Uses transfer::share_object() making OracleConfig globally accessible - can this be exploited if access controls are insufficient elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_interval()] [No Validation] Returns raw update_interval without validation - can callers misuse extreme values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: coin_decimals()] [Unchecked Table Access] Uses aggregators[asset_type].decimals without checking contains() - will this panic for removed assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: dex_slippage()] [No Bounds] Returns raw dex_slippage which could be 0 or u256::MAX - can downstream code handle these edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [Access Control Model] Most critical functions are public(package) - can any module in the package call these without proper authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [Price Source Trust] Fully relies on Switchboard aggregators without backup oracles or sanity checks - what if Switchboard is compromised? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [No Circuit Breaker] No emergency pause mechanism if oracle data becomes unreliable - can price manipulation propagate to vault unchecked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [Missing Price Bounds] No minimum or maximum price bounds per asset - can zero or extremely high prices be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [Table Size Limits] Table<String, PriceInfo> can grow unbounded - can an attacker DoS by adding thousands of aggregators? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [No Asset Type Registry] No whitelist of valid asset types - can arbitrary strings be used as asset types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Module: vault_oracle] [Event Replay] Events can be emitted multiple times in different transactions - can this confuse off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price() + update_price()] [Atomicity] get_asset_price() reads while update_price() writes - can race conditions cause inconsistent price reads? (Medium)"
