  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Enclave Format] mr_enclave is typically 32 bytes for SGX. If length is unchecked and arbitrary data is accepted, could this corrupt enclave verification in downstream oracle operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Ordering] oracle.enable_oracle() is called before queue.set_last_queue_override_ms(). If enable_oracle() reverts after partial state change, could queue timestamp update be inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp Atomicity] Between enable_oracle() and set_last_queue_override_ms(), if another transaction overrides the same oracle, could timestamp reflect wrong override ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Rollback Safety] If event emission fails but state changes succeed, could oracle and queue enter inconsistent state without observable event trail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validation-Actuation Gap] validate() and actuate() are separate functions. Could reentrancy between them allow state changes that invalidate validation assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle State Race] If oracle is being updated by feed posting transaction concurrently with override, could race condition corrupt oracle internal state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Mismatch] QueueOracleOverride event uses oracle.id() and queue.id() directly. If IDs can change post-validation (wrapping, move semantics), could event log wrong objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Copying] secp256k1_key and mr_enclave are copied into event. For large vectors, could this cause excessive gas consumption enabling DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Failure] If event::emit() fails silently or is rate-limited, could critical override operations complete without audit trail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Parsing] Off-chain systems parsing QueueOracleOverride events must handle arbitrary-length vectors. Could malformed secp256k1_key/mr_enclave crash indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] QueueOracleOverride event lacks nonce or sequence number. Could event replay attacks confuse off-chain monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Clock Oracle] clock.timestamp_ms() is trusted without validation. If Clock object can be manipulated or forked, could attacker set arbitrary queue override timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp Monotonicity] No check ensures new timestamp > previous last_queue_override_ms. Could clock skew or manipulation cause non-monotonic override timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Clock Freshness] Clock object passed by caller could be stale reference. Does Sui guarantee clock freshness, or could old Clock enable timestamp manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp vs Expiration] If clock.timestamp_ms() >= expiration_time_ms at override time, oracle becomes immediately expired. Could this cause vault operation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Future Timestamp] If Clock can provide future timestamps through epoch boundary bugs, could queue appear to have overrides that haven't happened yet? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [External Call Reentrancy] enable_oracle() is external call to Oracle module. Could reentrancy in enable_oracle() call back to run() with different parameters, causing state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Mutation Reentrancy] set_last_queue_override_ms() mutates queue. If Queue module has reentrancy allowing callback before state commit, could timestamp be overwritten? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Reentrancy] Multiple external reads (queue.version(), oracle.version(), etc.). Could read reentrancy cause TOCTOU where state changes between checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Module Reentrancy] If Oracle or Queue modules have circular dependencies with this action, could indirect reentrancy enable recursive overrides? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Reentrancy] event::emit() is external call. Could event handler reentrancy call run() again before first override completes? (Low)",
