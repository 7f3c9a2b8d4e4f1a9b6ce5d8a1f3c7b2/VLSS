  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Race Condition] If multiple transactions call update_validators() concurrently, can vec_map updates race and cause lost updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [State Mutation] Modifying sorted_validators and is_sorted flag are separate operations, can reads between these see inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_top_validator()] [Empty Set] Asserts validators exist, but what if validators VecMap has entries but sorted_validators is empty due to bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_bad_validators()] [Empty Result] Returns empty vector if no validators have priority==0, can calling code handle empty result correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_total_stake()] [Missing Validator] Returns 0 if validator not found, can this hide errors where caller expects a validator to exist? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Zero Amount Requested] What happens if requested_amount is 0, does function still iterate and consume gas? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [First Stake] When creating new vault, gap=0 and length=1, but is this consistent with remove_stakes() expectations? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Last Stake] When removing last stake (gap=length-1), does the logic correctly handle cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Empty Vectors] If empty vectors are passed, function checks length==0 but still sets is_sorted=false in else branch, can this cause unnecessary re-sorting? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Zero Iterations] If max_iterations is 0, function returns immediately with zero balance, can this be used to probe system state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Zero Priority] Setting priority to 0 marks validator as removable, but can this be exploited to force removal of validators with active stakes? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validator()] [Priority Overwrite] Existing priorities are overwritten without checking current state, can this disrupt planned stake distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Equal Priorities] Multiple validators can have same priority, but sorting doesn't define tie-breaking rule, can this cause non-deterministic ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_bad_validators()] [Definition Ambiguity] 'Bad' validators are defined as priority==0, but does this align with actual validator performance or slashing status? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Premature Removal] When priority==0 and gap==length, validator is removed from vec_map and sorted_validators, but can external references to this validator cause issues? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Vector::swap_remove()] This changes validator ordering in sorted_validators, can this break assumptions about stable ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Vault Destruction] Vault is destroyed only if priority==0, can vaults with priority>0 accumulate unbounded empty stakes entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Split Decision] Splits occur if remainder >= MIST_PER_SUI, but what if split creates dust amounts that can't be withdrawn later? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Split and Principal] After split, principal_value is set to rest_requested_amount, but what if actual split amount differs due to rounding? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Non-Split Path] When not splitting, entire stake is removed, but what if this causes withdrawal of much more than requested, affecting fairness? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Epoch Check] Checks 'stake_activation_epoch > current_epoch' to skip pending stakes, but can this cause DoS if all stakes are pending? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Epoch Boundary] If called exactly at epoch boundary, can race conditions cause inconsistent activation status checks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [ObjectTable Growth] ObjectTable grows with each stake, but removed stakes leave gaps, can this cause memory fragmentation? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Balance Accumulation] Multiple Balance<SUI> objects are joined, can this grow unbounded and consume excessive resources? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Table Storage] Multiple Table/ObjectTable structures are nested, can this cause high storage costs? (Low)"
