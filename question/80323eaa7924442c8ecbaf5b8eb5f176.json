  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Constants: LT/EQ/GT] [Comparison Results] Used as return values for cmp() - if implementation returns wrong constant or caller expects different encoding, can comparison-based vault logic make inverted decisions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Copy Ability] Has copy, drop, store abilities - if vault stores I64 values and copies them assuming by-value semantics, can reference bugs cause unintended aliasing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Store Ability] Can be stored in global storage - if vault stores signed values on-chain and attacker directly modifies storage bypassing arithmetic functions, can accounting be corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Drop Ability] Can be dropped without cleanup - if vault creates temporary I64 values in operations and drops them, can improper cleanup cause resource leaks or state inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test: test_from_ok] [Boundary Test] Tests from(0) and from(10) - but doesn't test from(MAX_AS_U64-1), can off-by-one errors near maximum be missed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test: test_from_overflow] [Overflow Test] Tests overflow at MIN_AS_U64 - but what about MIN_AS_U64+1 through MAX_U64, are all invalid conversions properly rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test: test_neg_from] [Negation Test] Tests several values - but doesn't test mid-range values, can implementation have bugs in the middle of valid range? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test: test_wrapping_add] [Comprehensive Coverage] Extensive wrapping_add tests - but if actual implementation deviates from test expectations, can vault operations using wrapping math produce wrong results? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Tests: Multiple] [Stub vs Real] All tests call functions that abort - are these tests meant for a real implementation linked at runtime? If linking fails or wrong implementation linked, can vault use broken i64 math? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i64] [MMT Integration] Part of mmt_v3 (likely Momentum AMM math) - if vault adaptors for Momentum use this i64 module for liquidity calculations and all functions abort, can all Momentum adaptor operations be DoS'd? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i64] [Price Calculations] AMMs often use signed integers for price deltas - if Momentum adaptor calculates price impact using i64 and all functions abort, can vault never interact with Momentum pools? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i64] [Liquidity Math] Concentrated liquidity math may use signed ticks - if vault operations require signed tick calculations and i64 aborts, can this prevent liquidity provision/removal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i64] [External Dependency] This is a local dependency copy - if original mmt_v3 implementation is updated but this stub isn't, can vault use outdated/broken math? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Module: mmt_v3::i64] [Build Configuration] Functions abort - is this placeholder for native implementation or conditional compilation? If build misconfiguration causes stub to be used in production, can entire vault be bricked? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: wrapping_add()] [Intentional Wrapping] Wrapping operations are dangerous - if vault mistakenly uses wrapping_add() instead of add() for balance accounting, can silent overflow hide accounting errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: wrapping_sub()] [Intentional Wrapping] Wrapping subtraction - if vault uses wrapping_sub() for loss calculations expecting overflow detection, can losses wrap to profits silently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function Pairs] [Checked vs Wrapping] Duplicate functions with/without overflow checks - if vault code inconsistently chooses checked vs wrapping variants, can some code paths have safety while others don't? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [All Functions] [Error Handling] All functions abort with code 0 - if implementation uses abort codes to distinguish error types but vault catches all aborts equally, can vault mishandle different overflow scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: zero()] [Constructor Pattern] Provides zero() constructor - but if vault code uses from(0) instead of zero() and implementations diverge, can initialization inconsistencies occur? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Multiple Functions] [DoS Attack] If attacker can trigger any vault operation requiring i64 math and all functions abort, can attacker permanently DoS vault by forcing transactions through code paths using this module? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()/sub()] [Precision Attack] If actual implementation has precision loss at extremes and vault accumulates many small operations, can attacker perform dust attacks to slowly drain value through rounding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: mul()/div()] [Manipulation Attack] If vault uses signed math for share pricing and attacker can manipulate values to cause overflow, can attacker mint shares for free by wrapping share price to negative? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: cmp()] [Comparison Attack] If vault uses i64 comparisons for access control (e.g., balance >= threshold) and comparison implementation is flawed, can attacker bypass restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: abs()] [Magnitude Attack] If vault calculates fees based on absolute value of PnL and abs() overflows for MIN, can attacker trigger MAX loss but pay zero fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [All Functions] [Native Implementation] If functions are implemented as native Move runtime functions linked at deploy time but linking fails, can vault deploy succeed but fail at runtime when i64 operations are needed? (Critical)"
