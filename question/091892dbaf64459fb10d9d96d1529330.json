  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Duplicate Creation] Can create_reward_manager() be called twice for same vault, creating two reward managers with conflicting state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Creation Timing] If create_reward_manager() is called after vault has shares/deposits, does reward_manager correctly track existing shares? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Type Mismatch] Can create_reward_manager() be called with wrong PrincipalCoinType creating type confusion between vault and reward_manager? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Initialization State] After create_reward_manager(), are vault receipts immediately compatible with reward_manager or is additional setup needed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Bypass Loss Limit] Can admin call reset_loss_tolerance() after operation exceeds loss_tolerance but before end_op() to bypass the limit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Epoch Manipulation] Does reset_loss_tolerance() force epoch update or just reset counters? Can this be abused to reset mid-epoch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Base Value Capture] When reset_loss_tolerance() captures cur_epoch_loss_base_usd_value, can admin manipulate vault value first to set favorable baseline? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Multiple Resets] Can reset_loss_tolerance() be called multiple times in same epoch to keep resetting accumulated losses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [Reset During Operation] If reset_loss_tolerance() is called while operation is active, does this invalidate the operation's pre-check tolerance state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: reset_loss_tolerance()] [by_admin Flag] The function passes by_admin=true, does this bypass epoch checks that automatic resets enforce? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: set_vault_enabled + Operations] Can disabling vault during operation leave operation in inconsistent state where end_op() fails? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: set_deposit_fee + set_withdraw_fee] Can setting deposit_fee=0 and withdraw_fee=max allow users to deposit free then withdraw is economically forced? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: upgrade functions] If upgrade_vault(), upgrade_reward_manager(), and upgrade_oracle_config() are called in wrong order, can this create version mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: add + remove aggregator] Can rapidly calling add_switchboard_aggregator() then remove_switchboard_aggregator() cause oracle state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: set_loss_tolerance + reset_loss_tolerance] Can admin set very low tolerance, wait for operation to nearly hit it, then reset to allow more operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: create_operator_cap + set_operator_freezed] Can operator_cap be created and immediately used before admin can freeze it? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: retrieve_fee admin + operator] Can admin and operator race to retrieve same fees causing double-spend or underflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: locking times] Can setting locking_time_for_cancel=0 and locking_time_for_withdraw=0 enable flash-loan style share manipulation? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function: set_vault_enabled + retrieve_fee] Can vault be disabled to prevent fee retrieval while still collecting fees? (Medium)"
