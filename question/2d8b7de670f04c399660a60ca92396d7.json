(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Missing Access Control] Since run() is public entry, can any user call it regardless of their relationship to the aggregator (validation will fail, but still wastes resources)? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Aggregator Mutability] Since run() takes &mut Aggregator, can multiple run() calls in the same transaction block create race conditions? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Module: aggregator] [Integration Risk] If aggregator.set_authority() doesn't properly update internal state, can this create phantom authorities that pass validation but don't actually control the aggregator? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Module: aggregator] [Version Incompatibility] If the aggregator module updates its version to 2, will all aggregator_set_authority_action calls fail permanently until this module is updated? (High)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Module: sui::event] [Event Emission Failure] If event::emit() silently fails, does the authority change still persist, creating an untracked authority transfer? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Aggregator Attack] Can an attacker gain authority over multiple aggregators and coordinate authority changes to create systemic oracle failures?
