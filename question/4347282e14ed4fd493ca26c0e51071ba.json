  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Integration: calculate_borrow_rate + calculate_supply_rate] [Rate Spread] If reserve_factor causes supply_rate to exceed borrow_rate due to underflow, does this violate the invariant that protocol earns spread, causing insolvency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Integration: calculate_compounded_interest + calculate_linear_interest] [Consistency] These two functions may be used in different contexts - if mixed incorrectly, can borrowers pay compound while suppliers earn linear, creating unfair advantage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Integration: calculate_value + calculate_amount] [Rounding Attack] By repeatedly converting amount->value->amount, can an attacker exploit rounding to extract value from the protocol through precision loss accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Integration: All rate functions] [Timestamp Consistency] If Clock timestamp is manipulated or moves backwards, can this cause negative timestamp_difference breaking all interest calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Storage mutations] [Reentrancy] The storage parameter is &mut in caculate_utilization but only reads - can external calls during storage access cause reentrancy issues with stale data? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Constants] [Dependency] All functions depend on constants::seconds_per_year() - if this module is malicious or buggy returning 0 or wrong values, can it break all interest calculations globally? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Ray Math] [Precision] All rate calculations use ray_math with 27 decimal precision - if downstream code expects different precision, can this cause 1e27x errors in interest amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Oracle] [Shared State] Multiple functions read oracle prices - if PriceOracle is shared mutable state, can concurrent reads get inconsistent prices enabling MEV or front-running? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Error Handling] [Panic DoS] The only error check is assert!(is_valid, error::invalid_price()) - can other overflow/underflow conditions cause panics that DoS critical protocol operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: caculate_utilization()] [Asset Isolation] The asset parameter is u8 - is there validation preventing cross-asset utilization calculation using wrong asset indices causing contaminated rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [Asset Isolation] Can an attacker pass wrong asset ID to calculate_borrow_rate to get rates for a different asset with different parameters, enabling rate arbitrage across assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_supply_rate()] [Asset Isolation] If borrow_rate is calculated for asset A but passed to calculate_supply_rate for asset B, does this cause incorrect supply rate and accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Multi-Asset] When converting multiple asset amounts to values, if oracle_id mapping is wrong, can attacker use one asset's price for another to misvalue collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Multi-Asset] Can an attacker convert value to wrong asset amount by manipulating oracle_id, receiving high-value asset amount at low-value asset price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [Governance Attack] If governance can update base_rate, multiplier, jump_rate_multiplier without bounds, can malicious governance set rates to 0 or u256::MAX to break the protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [Governance Attack] If optimal_utilization can be changed mid-operation, can this cause sudden rate spikes during borrower positions, causing unfair liquidations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_supply_rate()] [Governance Attack] Can governance set reserve_factor > RAY (>100%) to create negative supplier rates through underflow, stealing all interest from suppliers? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Constants] [Governance Attack] If constants::seconds_per_year() can be changed by governance, can they set it to 1 to make annual rates become per-second rates, charging 31536000x interest? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Module-level: Oracle] [Governance Attack] Can governance replace the PriceOracle object with malicious one that always returns is_valid=true but manipulated prices, breaking all value calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: caculate_utilization()] [Economic Attack] If utilization calculation is exploitable, can whales manipulate utilization by flash borrowing to push utilization over optimal_utilization triggering jump rates and profiting from shorting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [Economic Attack] If jump_rate_multiplier is very high, can attackers deliberately push utilization over threshold to cause rate spike, forcing leveraged positions to liquidate for profit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_supply_rate()] [Economic Attack] If supply_rate is disproportionately low due to high reserve_factor, can this cause supplier exodus leaving protocol insolvent when borrowers can't be matched? (Medium)",
