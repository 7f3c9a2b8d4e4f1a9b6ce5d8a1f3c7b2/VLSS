  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Pool Mutation] Does taking &mut MomentumPool allow the function to mutate pool state, and can this be exploited to manipulate pricing? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Position Ownership] Is there validation that the position belongs to the vault, or can external positions be valued? (High)",
