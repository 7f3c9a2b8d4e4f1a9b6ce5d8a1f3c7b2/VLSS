  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Failed Transactions] If vault operations include pool creation that aborts on get_tick_spacing(), users pay gas for failed transactions losing funds without achieving operation intent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization Gas] If init() is called repeatedly (knowing it aborts), could attacker waste network resources on failed initialization attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Update Function] No function exists to update existing fee rate mappings. Could this force pool recreation instead of fee updates, locking liquidity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Remove Function] No function to remove deprecated fee rates. Could obsolete fee rates accumulate, confusing integrators and wasting storage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Query All Function] No function to list all supported fee rates. Must integrators iterate or guess, causing operational difficulties? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [No Error Details] Function aborts without error message. Could this make debugging integration issues difficult, delaying vulnerability discovery? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented enable_fee_rate_internal] [Missing Implementation] This critical function is referenced but not defined. Does incomplete implementation indicate rushed deployment with security gaps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Field Addition] If new fields are added to GlobalConfig in upgrade, will existing shared object need migration? Could migration fail, bricking the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Package Upgrade] When mmt_v3 package is upgraded with functional implementations, could existing pools referencing old stub module face compatibility issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Table Migration] If fee rate denominator changes (e.g., 1e6 to 1e18), will table need complete rebuild? Could this cause downtime or config loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [create_pool Coupling] create_pool::new() requires GlobalConfig. If GlobalConfig is unavailable, does entire pool creation system fail, DoS'ing protocol expansion? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Circular Dependency] Could GlobalConfig depend on pool module for validation while pools depend on GlobalConfig for creation, creating initialization deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Pool Math Coupling] If pool tick math assumes tick_spacing is always valid power of 2 or specific range, could arbitrary tick spacing values cause math errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: EnableFeeRateEvent] [No Disable Event] Only enable event exists. If fee rates are removed, will off-chain systems miss the change, showing incorrect supported fee tiers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: EnableFeeRateEvent] [No Timestamp] Event has no timestamp field. Could event ordering be ambiguous if multiple fee rates enabled in same block? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: EnableFeeRateEvent] [No Old Value] Event doesn't store previous tick_spacing if fee rate is updated. Could this make audit trails incomplete? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Frontrun Attack] If attacker monitors mempool for pool creation with fee_rate X, could they add/remove fee_rate X to cause transaction failure, griefing pool creators? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Sandwich Attack] Could attacker manipulate fee rates before large vault rebalancing transaction to force vault into high-fee pools, extracting value from users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Oracle Manipulation] If tick_spacing affects price calculations, could attacker set tick_spacing to extreme values causing price oracle manipulation in pools? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented init_] [Hardcoded Backdoor] Could hardcoded fee rates in test init be intentional backdoor allowing privileged pools with specific fees? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Reentrancy] If table modifications trigger callbacks or events with external calls, could reentrancy occur modifying GlobalConfig mid-operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Read-Only Reentrancy] Could read-only function be called during table modification, returning inconsistent tick_spacing values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Tick Spacing Precision] With u32 tick_spacing, maximum value is ~4.2B. Could extremely volatile assets need larger tick spacing causing overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Rounding Errors] If tick_spacing is used in price calculations, could integer division create rounding errors accumulating over many swaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [State Invariants] No invariant checking exists. Could GlobalConfig reach invalid state where fee_rate and tick_spacing are inconsistent? (Medium)"
