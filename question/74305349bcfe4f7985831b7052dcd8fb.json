(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can flash loan-style attacks manipulate on-chain oracle prices (if Pyth/Supra consume on-chain data) to briefly pass validation and exploit vault operations? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle Griefing] Can attackers DoS the protocol by submitting transactions that cause oracle queries to fail, preventing all vault operations for affected assets? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Precision Loss] When converting between oracle native precision and target decimal precision, can precision loss cause prices to round down to zero for low-value assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Truncation Attack] Can attackers exploit predictable rounding behavior to consistently gain small advantages that accumulate to significant value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Adaptor Selection] How does get_price_from_adaptor determine which oracle to query (Supra vs Pyth), and can incorrect selection return wrong price types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Adaptor Failure] If an adaptor function panics or aborts, does the entire price fetch fail, or can it fall through to return garbage values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Adaptor Return Format] Are there assumptions about the format or scaling of values returned by get_price_from_adaptor that could be violated by updated adaptor implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical Manipulation] Can the historical_price stored in the feed be manipulated to extreme values, causing all future price validations to fail or all to pass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical Staleness] If historical price is never updated, can the historical_price_ttl expire, causing validate_price_range_and_history to always reject valid prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical Bootstrap] During initial deployment when no historical_price exists, can the validation logic fail or accept any price value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Inversion] Can misconfigured thresholds (threshold1 > threshold2) cause validate_price_difference to return unexpected severity levels? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Zero] If price_diff_threshold1 or threshold2 are set to 0, does this make validation extremely strict (rejecting any difference) or permissive (accepting all)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Overflow] Can threshold percentage calculations overflow when multiplied by large prices, causing comparison logic to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Feed Switching] If a feed_address is reconfigured to point to a different asset oracle, can cached or stale price data from the old asset contaminate new asset pricing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Multi-Feed Arbitrage] Can attackers exploit price discrepancies between multiple feed_addresses for the same underlying asset to arbitrage vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Feed Disable Timing] Can a feed be disabled after price fetch begins but before validation completes, causing partially validated prices to be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Warning Level] When severity == level_warning, execution continues with potentially divergent prices - can this be exploited during market stress when price feeds legitimately diverge? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Severity Threshold] Can the severity level gradually escalate from normal to warning to error without triggering protective measures until it's too late? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Severity Reset] How and when does severity level reset back to normal, and can attackers exploit the reset timing to bypass restrictions? (Medium)",
