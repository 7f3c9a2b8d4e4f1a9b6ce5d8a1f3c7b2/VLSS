  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_index_by_rule()] [Default Value] Can returning 0 when user_index doesn't exist cause incorrect 'global_index - 0' calculations for new users who haven't interacted yet? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_borrow_fee()] [Zero Fee] When borrow_fee_rate is 0, does returning 0 fee bypass the fee collection logic entirely or does it still attempt to split 0 amount unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Rate Update Timing] Can setting rate immediately after last_update_at is set cause duplicate index increase for the same time period? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Change Impact] When rate changes mid-period, does calculate_global_index correctly handle the transition or does it over/under-reward for the period? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: update_reward_state_by_rule_and_balance()] [State Update Order] Does updating rule.last_update_at before rule.global_index or vice versa create a window where index and timestamp are inconsistent?

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Balance Type] Does using user_effective_supply for supply option and user_effective_borrow for borrow option correctly match the reward type, or could mismatch cause incorrect rewards?
