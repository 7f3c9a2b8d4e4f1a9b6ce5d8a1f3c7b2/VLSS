  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Split Without Check] Line 173 splits amount from migration_storage.sui_balance without verifying if balance is sufficient after the split - could this cause underflow? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Ratio Validation] The sanity check at line 179 asserts ratio <= min_ratio, but this allows ratio to equal min_ratio exactly - is this intentional or should it be strict inequality for slippage protection? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Ratio Manipulation] The ratio is checked AFTER import operations at lines 173-174 - could an attacker manipulate the pool state during the temporary unpause window to affect the ratio unfavorably? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Min Ratio Bypass] What if min_ratio is set to u64::MAX by a malicious admin? The check at line 179 would always pass, removing slippage protection completely. (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Rebalance Impact] The rebalance() call at line 174 redistributes stakes - if validator weights are manipulated before this call, could the final ratio diverge significantly from expectations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Flow: Overall] [Order Enforcement] The migration flow comments show order 1-5, but what prevents calling import_stakes (step 4) before take_unclaimed_fees (step 3)? No sequential ordering enforced at function level. (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Multiple Calls] export_stakes() can be called multiple times with max_iterations - what prevents an attacker from calling it with iterations=0 repeatedly to spam events? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Multiple Imports] import_stakes() can be called multiple times - is there a risk that the pool is left in an inconsistent state if imports are split across multiple transactions with different market conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: destroy_migration_cap()] [Premature Destroy] destroy_migration_cap() checks exported_count at line 193 but not whether all exports have been imported - could the cap be destroyed prematurely leaving funds in migration_storage? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Fees Before Export] Nothing prevents take_unclaimed_fees() from being called before export_stakes() completes - could fees be taken from an incomplete migration balance? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Pool Before Export] create_stake_pool() can be called before any exports - what if users interact with the empty V2 pool before migration funds arrive? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Validator Set Mutation] export_stakes_from_v1() mutably accesses validator_set at line 112-114 - if this function fails partway through validator iteration, is the validator_set left corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [System State Consistency] SuiSystemState is passed as mutable at line 108 - could concurrent system state changes during export cause inconsistent withdrawal amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Rebalance Failure] If rebalance() at line 174 fails due to validator issues, the pool remains unpaused (line 172) and migration_storage has already lost the split balance at line 173 - how is this recovered? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [System State Mutation] SuiSystemState is mutated during rebalance at line 174 - if the system is in an epoch transition, could this cause stake delegation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Pending Mutation] Lines 120-121 mutate native_pool.mut_pending() - if pending contains staking positions still in flight, could withdrawal_all() fail or return incorrect amounts? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Reentrancy via Events] ExportedEvent is emitted at line 125 after balances are joined - could event handlers reenter migration functions to exploit intermediate state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Transfer Reentrancy] public_transfer at line 147 transfers coins before unclaimed_fees is zeroed at line 148 - if recipient is a shared object with a fallback function, could it reenter? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Cross-Function Reentrancy] During the unpause window (lines 172-175), could another transaction call user-facing stake_pool functions concurrently, causing race conditions in sui_pool balance? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: deposit_sui()] [Concurrent Deposits] Multiple deposit_sui() calls could race on migration_storage.sui_balance updates at line 210-211 - is the shared object access properly synchronized? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Event Data Integrity] ExportedEvent at lines 125-133 includes total_sui_balance, but this is after joining balances - if join operations change amounts due to precision loss, events show incorrect data. (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Missing Event Data] UnclaimedFeesEvent at lines 150-153 only emits amount but not recipient - how do auditors verify fees went to the correct address? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Event Timing] ImportedEvent is emitted at line 181 after all operations - if assertions fail after emission, off-chain indexers may record incorrect state. (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: deposit_sui()] [Event Overwrite] SuiChangedEvent at lines 213-217 emits the new total balance, but doesn't indicate whether this was a deposit or withdrawal - how to distinguish operations? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Max Iterations Zero] If max_iterations=0 is passed at line 109, does export_stakes_from_v1 handle this gracefully or does it cause unexpected behavior? (Low)"
