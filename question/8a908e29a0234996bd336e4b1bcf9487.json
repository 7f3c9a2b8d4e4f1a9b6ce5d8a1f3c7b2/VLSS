  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Consistency] Can concurrent calls to run() from the legitimate authority for different fee types T1 and T2 create race conditions where the fee_types vector becomes corrupted or contains partial updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Corruption] If the Queue module allows fee_types vector to grow unbounded, can an attacker with authority repeatedly call run() to add fee types until the vector reaches maximum capacity, causing DoS for all queue operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the fact that QueueFeeTypeAdded event is emitted after add_fee_type() to create a time window where off-chain indexers see an inconsistent state, potentially allowing double-spend or incorrect fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Struct: QueueFeeTypeAdded] [Event Forgery] If an attacker can call event::emit() directly with a forged QueueFeeTypeAdded event (without calling run()), can they trick off-chain systems into believing a fee type was added when it wasn't? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Integrity] If type_name::get<Coin<T>>() returns a different TypeName than what's actually added to fee_types due to a bug, will the emitted event contain incorrect fee_type data that misleads monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] Can an attacker record a legitimate QueueFeeTypeAdded event and replay it in a different transaction context to confuse event listeners or trigger unintended state changes in dependent systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Event] If queue.add_fee_type<T>() returns early due to the fee type already existing, no event is emitted - can this lack of event for no-op calls allow attackers to hide repeated attempts to add fee types that should trigger rate limiting or monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Order] If multiple run() calls are batched in a single transaction, can the order of QueueFeeTypeAdded events be manipulated to misrepresent the actual sequence of fee type additions to off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Module Integration] If queue.add_fee_type<T>() in the Queue module has a bug where it doesn't actually add the fee type to fee_types despite returning successfully, will the emitted event create a false record of fee type addition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Integration] If the Queue module's has_authority() function can be bypassed through capability objects or friend modules, does run() provide sufficient protection against unauthorized fee type additions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Module Integration] Can an attacker exploit inconsistencies between queue.id() returning the object ID and the actual queue's identity if the Queue module allows ID spoofing or collision? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Module Integration] If queue.version() can be manipulated through reflection or dynamic field access without triggering security checks in the Queue module, can validate() be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Integration] If the Queue module allows the fee_types vector to be modified through package-level friend functions while run() is executing, can this create race conditions leading to duplicate fee types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Context Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the TxContext (e.g., by calling from a different module that modifies ctx.sender()) to bypass the authority check in has_authority()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Context Exploit] If ctx is passed to validate() by reference but modified after validation before actuate() uses the queue, can the authority check be bypassed through context mutation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Context Spoofing] Can an attacker create a custom TxContext object with a spoofed sender address and pass it to run() if the function doesn't properly validate that ctx comes from the Sui runtime? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Batching] Can an attacker batch multiple run() calls in a single transaction with different queue references where the first call legitimately passes validation but subsequent calls operate on queues they shouldn't have access to? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker exploit reentrancy by having queue.add_fee_type<T>() call back into run() through a malicious type T's constructor or method, bypassing validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Cross-Function Reentrancy] If actuate() is called directly by another module while run() is executing, can this create state inconsistencies where validation is bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Concurrency] Can multiple transactions calling run() for the same queue simultaneously cause the fee_types vector to be corrupted if Sui's consensus doesn't properly serialize writes? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Handling] If queue.version() throws an exception or panics instead of returning a value, does the assert at line 24 catch it properly, or can an attacker exploit uncaught exceptions to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Error: EInvalidAuthority] [Error Bypass] Can an attacker suppress the EInvalidAuthority error through transaction failure handling or exception catching mechanisms to continue execution after failed authority check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Error: EInvalidQueueVersion] [Error Bypass] If the EInvalidQueueVersion error message is used by off-chain systems to detect invalid operations, can an attacker manipulate error messages to hide malicious activity?
