  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Abs Overflow] [Loss Reporting DoS] Attacker causes vault loss exactly equal to MIN_AS_U64, then triggers abs(MIN_AS_U64) in loss reporting function causing abort and preventing emergency withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Sign Bit Manipulation] [Fee Reversal] Attacker triggers overflow in fee calculation using mul() that wraps positive fee to negative value via wrapping behavior (if wrapping_mul exists), causing protocol to pay user instead of collecting fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Type Conversion] [Oracle Price Attack] Attacker manipulates oracle to return negative price change as I64, which gets converted via as_u64() appearing as huge positive price change, allowing overpriced assets to be deposited for inflated shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Modulo Manipulation] [Epoch Boundary] If epoch transition uses mod() to determine phase and negative values have incorrect sign, could attacker trigger wrong epoch phase allowing actions in locked periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Shift Operations] [Fixed-Point Overflow] If vault uses shl() for fixed-point multiplication and shifts into sign bit, could positive amounts become negative causing accounting corruption in share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Associativity] add(add(A, B), C) should equal add(A, add(B, C)) for valid inputs - could non-associative addition break cumulative calculations in multi-step operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: mul()] [Commutativity] mul(A, B) should equal mul(B, A) - could non-commutative multiplication cause position-dependent results in fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Inverse of Add] sub(add(A, B), B) should equal A when no overflow - could add/sub not being inverses break balance reconciliation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: div()] [Inverse of Mul] div(mul(A, B), B) should equal A for non-zero B - could non-invertibility cause precision loss in ratio conversions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: wrapping_add()] [Distributivity] Does wrapping_add(A, wrapping_add(B, C)) = wrapping_add(wrapping_add(A, B), C)? Wrapping could break associativity causing order-dependent results? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: cmp()] [Transitivity] If cmp(A, B) = LT and cmp(B, C) = LT, then cmp(A, C) must = LT - could non-transitive comparison break sorting algorithms? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: cmp()] [Reflexivity] cmp(A, A) must always equal EQ - could self-comparison with MIN_AS_U64 or MAX_AS_U64 fail reflexivity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: cmp()] [Antisymmetry] If cmp(A, B) = LT then cmp(B, A) must = GT - could antisymmetry fail causing inconsistent ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: eq()] [Symmetry] eq(A, B) must equal eq(B, A) - could non-symmetric equality break hash map implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: eq()] [Transitivity] If eq(A, B) and eq(B, C) then must eq(A, C) - could non-transitive equality break equivalence classes in grouping logic? (Low)"
