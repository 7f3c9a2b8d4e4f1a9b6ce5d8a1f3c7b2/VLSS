  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [OTW Claim Bypass] The one-time witness (ON_DEMAND) is claimed via package::claim_and_keep() but not used elsewhere - can an attacker create a fake package with same module name to confuse package verification? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [ID Type Confusion] Sui IDs are just addresses - can an attacker pass an address that's valid but points to wrong object type, and will Sui runtime catch this before causing crashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Object Table Lookup] If consuming code uses oracle_queue ID to look up dynamic fields or object tables, can invalid IDs cause table lookup errors that crash transactions? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: All Setters] [Coordinated State Corruption] Can an attacker atomically call all three setters in one transaction to create completely malicious oracle configuration that bypasses any single-field validation?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Vault Value Manipulation] If Volo Vault reads oracle_queue to get asset prices for vault value calculation, can replacing this ID cause vault to use manipulated prices enabling theft via inflated share values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [Health Limiter Bypass] If Navi health limiter uses oracle prices from this queue, can replacing queue with one returning favorable prices bypass health factor checks and enable over-leverage? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: guardian_queue()] [Loss Tolerance Exploit] If guardian queue is supposed to prevent vault losses beyond tolerance, can replacing it with permissive guardian allow losses to exceed configured tolerance?

(Critical)",
