  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Vector Length Mismatch] Asserts validators.length() == priorities.length(), but what if one is much larger and assertion happens after some memory allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Requested Amount] No upper bound check on requested_amount, can u64::MAX cause issues in calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Max Iterations] No validation that max_iterations > 0, can zero iterations cause no-op calls that waste gas? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Triple Return] Returns (Balance, principal, reward) but no indication of whether full amount was withdrawn, can calling code misinterpret partial withdrawals? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_total_stake()] [Silent Zero] Returns 0 for missing validators without error, can this hide bugs where validator should exist? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Count Mismatch] Returns exported_count and exported_sui_amount separately, but no validation they're consistent, can they diverge? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Loop Condition] 'while (vault_mut_ref.gap < vault_mut_ref.length && balance::value(&total_withdrawn) < requested_amount)', can incorrect gap/length cause infinite loop? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Early Break] Loop breaks on pending stakes, but continues if stake is ready, can adversary arrange stakes to maximize gas costs? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Nested Loops] Inner loop iterates over sorted list for each validator, can this be exploited for gas griefing? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_bad_validators()] [Full Scan] Scans all validators to find zero priorities, can this be expensive if MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE validators exist? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Multi-Validator Loop] Outer loop over validators and inner loop over stakes, can nested iteration cause excessive gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: is_sorted] [Inconsistent Updates] is_sorted is set to false by update_validators() and true by sort_validators(), but no validation that it's true before relying on sorted order, can unsorted access occur? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: is_sorted] [Race Window] If is_sorted is read as true but then update_validators() is called before sort_validators(), can stale sorted_validators be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [SuiSystem Dependency] Calls 'sui_system::request_withdraw_stake_non_entry()', can changes in SuiSystem module break this function? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Staking Pool Functions] Uses staking_pool::stake_activation_epoch and staking_pool::split, can breaking changes in staking_pool affect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [Staking Pool Amount] Calls staking_pool::staked_sui_amount(), can this return unexpected values if stake is in unusual state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: test_create()] [Public Test Function] Creates and shares ValidatorSet, can this be misused if test code is accidentally included in production? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: test_update_and_sort()] [Direct Access] Exposes update_validators() and sort_validators() without access control, can this be exploited if test functions are available? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake_for_testing()] [Test Wrapper] Provides public access to package function, can compilation settings accidentally expose this? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes_for_testing()] [Test Wrapper] Exposes stake removal in tests, can this bypass access controls if present in production build? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_top_validator()] [Vector Borrow] Uses '*vector::borrow(&self.sorted_validators, 0)' which can abort if empty, but assertion checks length!=0 first, can race conditions cause abort? (Low)"
