  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Type String Manipulation] Can the asset_type parameter (line 23) contain special characters or escape sequences that bypass vault storage key checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Position Reference Lifetime] Is there a guarantee that the position reference remains valid throughout the calculation, or could it be deleted/transferred mid-execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Get Defi Asset Type Safety] Does get_defi_asset<PrincipalCoinType, CetusPosition>() validate that the asset is actually a CetusPosition, or could it return a different type causing runtime errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Finish Update Asset Value Validation] Does finish_update_asset_value() check that the asset_type matches the previously borrowed asset, or could this update the wrong asset's value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Vault Mutation Safety] Since vault is passed as &mut (line 20), could calculate_cetus_position_value() or finish_update_asset_value() perform unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Borrowing Lock] Does get_defi_asset() lock the asset for the duration of the update, or could another transaction modify/remove the position before finish_update_asset_value() is called? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Value Calculation Order] Does the order of operations matter in value_a + value_b (line 74)? Could different orderings produce different results due to overflow/rounding? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Intermediate Value Storage] Are value_a and value_b (lines 71-72) computed atomically, or could external state changes between these calculations cause inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Repeated Calculation Consistency] If calculate_cetus_position_value() is called twice in quick succession, should it return identical values? Could oracle price updates or pool state changes cause divergence? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Extreme Price Deviation] If pool_price deviates from relative_price_from_oracle by exactly the slippage threshold (line 64), is the assertion inclusive or exclusive? Could off-by-one errors allow slightly out-of-bounds prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Inverse Price Handling] Does the code correctly handle cases where price_a < price_b vs price_a > price_b, especially in the slippage calculation (lines 52-66)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Price Ratio Extremes] If relative_price_from_oracle is extremely small (near 0) or extremely large (near u256::max), could this cause the slippage calculation to misbehave? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Asymmetric Position Values] If value_a >> value_b or vice versa, could this indicate an attack or misconfiguration that should be detected but isn't? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Single-Sided Position] If a position has amount_a > 0 but amount_b = 0 (or vice versa), is this valid in Cetus CLMM? If not, should there be validation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Position Out of Range] For concentrated liquidity positions, if the current pool price is outside the position's range, should amount_a and amount_b be 0? If not, could this lead to misvaluations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Clock Timestamp Reliability] Does Sui's Clock object provide tamper-proof timestamps, or could validators manipulate clock.timestamp_ms() (line 29) within consensus bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Oracle Timestamp Check] Do vault_oracle::get_asset_price() calls (lines 50-51) validate that the oracle timestamp is recent relative to the clock parameter, or could stale oracle data be used? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Timestamp Monotonicity] If clock.timestamp_ms() somehow decreases between calls (e.g., due to chain reorg), could this corrupt vault value update logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Error Code Collision] Is ERR_INVALID_POOL_PRICE = 6_001 (line 17) unique across the entire Volo codebase, or could it collide with other error codes causing ambiguity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Insufficient Error Context] Does the ERR_INVALID_POOL_PRICE assertion (line 63) provide enough context for debugging? Could adding events or error messages help operators respond to slippage violations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Type Name Format] Does into_string(get<CoinType>()) (lines 43-44) return fully qualified type names (e.g., '0x2::sui::SUI') consistently, or could different formats cause config lookups to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Type Name Injection] Could a maliciously named package create coin types whose string representation matches legitimate coins, causing config lookups to return wrong decimals/prices? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Type Uniqueness] Can multiple Cetus positions be stored under different asset_type strings, and if so, does this allow selective valuation updates to manipulate total vault value? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Type Validation] Does the vault validate that asset_type corresponds to an actual Cetus position, or could arbitrary strings be passed causing lookups to fail? (Medium)"
