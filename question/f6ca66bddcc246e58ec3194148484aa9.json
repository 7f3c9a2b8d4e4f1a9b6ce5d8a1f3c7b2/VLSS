  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Stale Data] Since unwrap_unstake_ticket doesn't remove values from max_history_value table, does get_max_supply_for_2epochs at lines 81-94 return inflated values based on burned tickets? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [State Ordering] If add_to_epoch at line 112 fails or panics, does line 114 still increment total_supply, causing metadata state to become inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to add_to_epoch at lines 102-107 race on table operations, causing some values to be dropped or double-counted? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: unwrap_unstake_ticket()] [Supply Invariant] If total_supply at line 145 is decremented but ticket value was never added to total_supply (due to prior bug), does this create negative accounting? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_total_supply()] [Consistency] Can get_total_supply at line 60-62 return stale values if concurrent wrap/unwrap operations are modifying total_supply, leading to incorrect supply-based decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Metadata Mutation] If metadata object is shared across multiple pools, can concurrent wrap_unstake_ticket calls at line 111 corrupt total_supply or max_history_value table? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Memory Leak] Since max_history_value table at lines 102-107 never removes old epoch entries, can this table grow unbounded causing storage exhaustion DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Stale History] Without cleanup mechanism, does max_history_value at lines 85-90 accumulate historical values forever, making supply calculations increasingly inaccurate over time? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Table Overflow] If same epoch receives millions of ticket minting calls, can line 104 *total = *total + value overflow the table entry without detection? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Epoch Boundary] At line 89 when current_epoch is 0, does current_epoch - 1 underflow to u64::MAX, causing lookup of wrong epoch in table? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Missing Cleanup] Since burned tickets don't update max_history_value, does the table accumulate inflated values that never decrease, permanently affecting supply limits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Logic Error] Why only sum 2 epochs at lines 85-90? If tickets unlock after 3+ epochs, does this cause incorrect supply cap calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Concurrent Modification] Can lines 102-107 race when multiple transactions in same epoch call wrap_unstake_ticket, causing lost updates to epoch total? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Missing Entry] If current_epoch exists but current_epoch-1 doesn't in table, does line 89 skip that epoch's value entirely, underestimating supply? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Zero Value] Can value=0 parameter at line 111 create zero-value tickets that consume resources but provide no economic value, enabling DoS through resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Fee Validation] Can unstake_fee parameter at line 111 be set to value or greater, causing users to lose money or receive nothing when burning tickets? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Epoch Validation] Can unlocked_in_epoch parameter be set to u64::MAX at line 111, creating tickets that can never be burned due to impossible unlock condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Past Epoch] Can unlocked_in_epoch be set to a past epoch at line 111, creating immediately unlockable tickets that bypass time-lock requirements? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Fee Overflow] If unstake_fee at line 111 is larger than value, does unwrap_unstake_ticket return more fee than principal, breaking fee collection logic? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Maximum Values] Can passing all parameters as u64::MAX at line 111 cause multiple overflows in ticket creation, epoch tracking, and supply accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Negative Lock Period] Without validation, can unlocked_in_epoch be less than current epoch at line 111, creating pre-unlocked tickets? (High)",
