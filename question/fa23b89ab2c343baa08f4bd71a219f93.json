  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Public Access] get_tick_spacing() is public without restrictions. Could public access to tick spacing data enable attackers to identify optimal tick ranges for liquidity manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented init_] [test_only Bypass] The commented init_ is marked test_only but contains actual initialization logic. Could developers accidentally remove test_only guard, exposing test initialization in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Fee Rate Overflow] Fee rates are u64. Could attacker register fee_rate = u64::MAX causing overflow when calculating fee amounts as (amount * fee_rate / fee_denominator) in swap logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Zero Fee Rate] If contains_fee_rate() accepts fee_rate = 0, could pools be created with zero fees, eliminating protocol revenue and enabling wash trading without cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Tick Spacing Zero] If tick_spacing = 0 is allowed, could this cause division by zero when calculating valid tick indices as (price_tick / tick_spacing)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented Fee Values] [Fee Rate Manipulation] The commented code shows fee 10000 (1% if denominator is 1e6). Could missing maximum bounds allow fees > 100%, extracting more than trade value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Precision Loss] With fee_rate as u64 and tick_spacing as u32, could type conversion between them cause precision loss or truncation in pool calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Missing Fee Rate] If get_tick_spacing() is called with a fee_rate not in the table, does it abort or return default? If abort, does it DoS pool operations; if default, does it allow misconfigured pools? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module Dependencies] [Vault Operations] Volo vault's momentum.adaptor borrows Momentum positions. If GlobalConfig functions abort, will vault operations fail when trying to create new positions during rebalancing, locking user deposits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: init()] [Vault Initialization] If volo vault initialization expects GlobalConfig to exist (via mmt_v3 dependency), will vault deployment fail or proceed with broken Momentum integration? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Asset Valuation] Vault's momentum adaptor calculates position values. If GlobalConfig's fee rates are incorrect/uninitialized, could position valuations be wrong, affecting share price calculations and enabling arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Position Management] When vault operator rebalances Momentum positions, incorrect tick spacing could place liquidity at wrong price ranges, causing IL or failed swaps. Does abort prevent this or cause operational DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Upgrade Path] If mmt_v3 is upgraded to fix abort statements, will volo vault require redeployment or can it use new GlobalConfig transparently? Could upgrade timing create state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Table Race Condition] If GlobalConfig is shared object and table modifications are not atomic, could concurrent transactions corrupt fee_rate->tick_spacing mappings during pool creation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Table Deletion] Sui Table supports remove operations. If fee rates can be deleted after pools are created, will existing pools referencing deleted fee rates fail on operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Table Iteration] If functions iterate over the table (not visible in stub), could attacker add many entries causing gas exhaustion DoS on read operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Key Collision] With u64 fee_rate keys, could collisions occur if same fee_rate is added twice, overwriting tick_spacing and breaking existing pools? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Table Storage Cost] Each table entry has storage cost. Without limits, could attacker drain protocol funds by adding unlimited fee rates, making GlobalConfig maintenance prohibitively expensive? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [u64 to u32 Cast] Fee rate is u64 but tick spacing is u32. If conversion logic exists, could large fee rates cause truncation when casting to tick spacing calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Return Type Assumption] Function returns u32 tick_spacing. Could caller code assume non-zero return, causing division by zero if zero is valid tick spacing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Bool Assumption] Returns bool but aborts. Could caller code not handle abort, expecting bool, causing unexpected transaction failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Concurrent Modifications] If GlobalConfig is shared and multiple pool creations happen simultaneously, could race conditions corrupt the fee_amount_tick_spacing table? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Line 37: Commented share_object] [Lock Contention] Sharing GlobalConfig makes it a hot object. Could high pool creation volume cause consensus delays or failed transactions due to contention? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Version Consistency] If GlobalConfig is read in transaction T1, modified in T2, then T1 completes, could T1 use stale fee rates creating pools with outdated config? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Gas Waste] Function aborts immediately but caller pays gas for function call and abort. Could this be used for gas griefing attacks on vault operations? (Low)"
