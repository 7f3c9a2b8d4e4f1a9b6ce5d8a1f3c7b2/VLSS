  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Decimal Mismatch] Different tokens may have different decimals, can consumers incorrectly assume uniform decimals causing magnitude errors in calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [No Price Range Checks] Even with valid=true, can extreme price values (near u256::MAX) cause overflow in consumers that multiply price * amount? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: price_object()] [Direct Price Access] Returns immutable reference to Price struct, can consumers read stale prices without checking timestamp, bypassing get_token_price() validity logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: price_object()] [Missing Version Check] price_object() doesn't call version_verification(), can it be used with outdated oracle versions causing incompatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: decimal()] [Mutable Reference Parameter] Takes &mut PriceOracle despite only reading, can this cause unintended mutable access patterns or prevent parallel reads? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: safe_decimal()] [Naming Confusion] safe_decimal() and decimal() have identical logic but different parameter mutability, can this confuse developers causing incorrect usage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: decimal()] [No Version Check] decimal() function doesn't call version_verification() unlike other functions, can it be called on migrated oracles with incompatible struct layouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Timestamp Logic] [Clock Manipulation] Can malicious validators manipulate Clock object to set arbitrary timestamps, making stale prices appear fresh or fresh prices appear stale? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Timestamp Logic] [Underflow Attack] If price.timestamp > current_ts due to clock skew, will current_ts - price.timestamp underflow causing staleness check to incorrectly pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Timestamp Logic] [Overflow in Interval] Can very large update_interval values cause current_ts - timestamp <= update_interval to overflow, incorrectly marking expired prices as valid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Timestamp Logic] [Millisecond Precision] Clock uses millisecond precision, can prices updated within the same millisecond cause ordering ambiguity in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Timestamp Logic] [No Timestamp Bounds] Can timestamp be set to 0 or u64::MAX during registration/update, causing staleness calculations to behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Table Storage] [Table Deletion] No function exists to remove prices from the table, can obsolete oracle_ids accumulate indefinitely causing storage bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Table Storage] [Table Capacity] Sui tables have no enforced size limit, can unlimited price registrations cause storage exhaustion or gas issues when iterating? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Table Storage] [Oracle ID Exhaustion] With u8 oracle_ids, only 256 tokens can be registered, can this limit be reached causing inability to add new price feeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Table Storage] [Concurrent Access] Multiple transactions calling table::borrow_mut simultaneously on the same oracle_id, can this cause race conditions in price updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Table Storage] [Borrow Lifetime] table::borrow_mut returns mutable reference, can this be held across multiple operations to block other updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Events] [Event Poisoning] PriceUpdated event emits both new and old prices, can an attacker cause event spam by rapidly toggling prices to flood monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Events] [Missing Events] update_token_price() and update_token_price_batch() don't emit events, can this allow silent price manipulations undetectable by offchain monitoring? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Events] [Event Order] If update_price() is called before the actual price struct update completes, can events be emitted with wrong timestamp ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Events] [Event Replay] Can malicious actors replay PriceUpdated events to confuse offchain systems into thinking prices changed when they didn't? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: Price] [Memory Layout] Price struct stores u256 value, can this cause alignment issues or excessive gas costs compared to using u128 or u64? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: Price] [No Copy Ability] Price has only store ability, can this prevent efficient value passing or require unnecessary borrowing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceOracle] [Shared Object Mutability] PriceOracle is shared, can concurrent transactions modifying different oracle_ids cause consensus issues or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceOracle] [Version Storage] Version is stored as u64, can this overflow after extremely many migrations or cause compatibility issues with version constants? (Low)"
