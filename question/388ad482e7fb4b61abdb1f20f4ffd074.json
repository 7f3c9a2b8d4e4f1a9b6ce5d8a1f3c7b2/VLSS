  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Position ID Mismatch] Is there validation that the position object passed to calculate_cetus_position_value() actually belongs to the vault and hasn't been swapped with another position object with inflated amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [U64 to U256 Conversion] When casting amount_a and amount_b to u256 (lines 71-72), are there scenarios where the u64 values are near max but the multiplication with normalized_price overflows u256? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Unclaimed Fees] Does pool.get_position_amounts() include unclaimed fees from the Cetus position, or only the principal liquidity? If fees are excluded, can they be claimed separately to extract value without updating vault valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Position Ownership] Is there a check that the position reference passed is actually owned by the vault, or could an attacker pass a reference to any Cetus position to inflate the vault's perceived value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Mul With Oracle Price Overflow] Can vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() overflow when multiplying large amount_a/amount_b by normalized_price (lines 71-72), especially if normalized_price has 18 decimals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Value Addition Overflow] After computing value_a and value_b, can their sum (line 74) overflow u256 if both positions hold maximum amounts of high-value tokens? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Value Precision Mismatch] If normalized_price_a and normalized_price_b have different decimal precision (lines 68-69), could value_a and value_b be in incompatible units, causing incorrect total valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Zero Value Attack] If calculated value_a + value_b equals 0 due to rounding or zero prices, can this be exploited to deposit worthless positions into the vault and mint shares? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Finish Update Bypass] Does finish_update_asset_value() validate that usd_value is reasonable (line 29), or could extremely high/low values be committed, corrupting vault accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Negative Value] While Move uses unsigned integers, can intermediate calculations in mul_with_oracle_price() or the oracle itself return unexpected values that appear as very large u256 due to underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Type Mismatch] Can asset_type string parameter (line 23) be manipulated to point to a different asset than the actual pool types CoinA/CoinB, causing the wrong position to be valued? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Generic Type Confusion] Can PrincipalCoinType, CoinA, and CoinB be mismatched such that get_defi_asset() returns a position incompatible with the pool, causing runtime errors or incorrect valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Type Name Manipulation] Can into_string(get<CoinTypeA>()) and into_string(get<CoinTypeB>()) be spoofed or do they reliably return canonical type names that match config mappings (lines 43-44)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Pool Type Mismatch] If the pool parameter has types CoinA/CoinB that don't match the position's actual pool types, would get_position_amounts() still succeed but return incorrect values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Asset Type Collision] If two different Cetus positions map to the same asset_type string through collision or manipulation, could updating one affect the other's valuation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Public Function Abuse] Since update_cetus_position_value() is public, can anyone call it at any time to update position values, potentially during operations when values should be frozen? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_cetus_position_value()] [Public Calculation Abuse] Since calculate_cetus_position_value() is public, can it be called with arbitrary pool/position references to extract price information or perform reconnaissance for attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Vault Reference Abuse] Can passing &mut Vault allow unauthorized state modifications beyond just updating asset values, if vault methods don't properly gate access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Pool Reference Abuse] Can passing &mut CetusPool to this public function allow unintended pool state changes through other Cetus module functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Config Reference Safety] Is the OracleConfig passed by immutable reference safe, or could passing a malicious config object with manipulated decimals/slippage cause valuation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [Reentrancy via Pool] Could pool.get_position_amounts() or pool.current_sqrt_price() trigger callbacks that re-enter vault functions, allowing state manipulation during valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/cetus_adaptor.move] [Function: update_cetus_position_value()] [State Inconsistency] If vault state changes between get_defi_asset() (line 26) and finish_update_asset_value() (line 29), could this cause the wrong asset to be updated with the calculated value?
