  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Price Magnitude Zero] If price_mag = 0 (price is zero), the function returns decimal::from(0). Can zero prices be exploited in vault calculations (e.g., dividing by zero price to get infinite shares)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Expo Sign Confusion] The logic branches on i64::get_is_negative(&expo). If the Pyth price_feed provides an expo with unexpected sign encoding, can this branch incorrectly, applying division when multiplication is needed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Always Returned] EMA price is parsed and returned even if spot price fails validation. If caller mistakenly uses EMA when spot is None, can stale or manipulated EMA prices be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA No Validation] EMA price undergoes no confidence or staleness checks. Can EMA be significantly divergent from spot, and if used as fallback, enable price manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Return Type Confusion] The function returns (Option<Decimal>, Decimal, PriceIdentifier) where spot is Option and EMA is always Decimal. Can caller code unwrap Option incorrectly, panicking when spot is None? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA vs Spot Divergence] If spot price fails confidence check but EMA passes, the divergence could be large. If vault logic uses EMA as fallback without additional checks, can this enable arbitrage or fund extraction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Staleness] EMA price may be based on old data even if not explicitly stale. If EMA reflects prices from hours ago and is used when spot fails, can outdated valuations be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Spot None Handling] When spot price is None, caller must handle this. If caller assumes spot is always Some and unwraps without check, can this cause transaction panics and DOS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Option Unwrap Panic] If caller uses option::unwrap() on the returned spot price without checking is_some(), transactions panic when confidence or staleness checks fail. Can attacker trigger this to DOS vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Fallback Oracle Assumption] Comment mentions 'caller can handle invalid prices gracefully by eg falling back to a different oracle'. If no fallback exists in caller, does returning None for spot price brick all operations requiring that price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Silent Failure] Returning None instead of aborting means price validation failures are silent. Can caller logic fail to detect this and proceed with default/zero values, enabling exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA as Default] If caller logic defaults to EMA when spot is None, but EMA has no validation, can unvalidated prices be used in critical operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Identifier Mismatch] Price identifier is returned alongside prices. If caller doesn't validate identifier matches expected asset, can prices from wrong asset be used (e.g., using ETH price for SUI)? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [PriceInfoObject Validation] The function accepts &PriceInfoObject without validating its authenticity. Can attacker provide malicious PriceInfoObject with crafted prices to bypass all checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Feed Extraction] The function extracts price_feed via price_info::get_price_feed(). If this returns stale or corrupted data from PriceInfoObject, are there additional validations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Identifier Trust] Price identifier is extracted from price_feed without validation. Can attacker swap identifiers to make one asset's price apply to another? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Clock Object Trust] The function accepts &Clock without validation. Can attacker provide malicious Clock object with manipulated timestamp to bypass staleness checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Pyth Module Dependency] The function depends on pyth::price, pyth::i64, pyth::price_feed, etc. If Pyth module has vulnerabilities (e.g., incorrect i64 operations), can these propagate to oracle price parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Negative Price Panic] Comment states 'suilend doesn't support negative prices'. i64::get_magnitude_if_positive() panics if price is negative. Can attacker provide negative Pyth price to DOS all oracle calls? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Negative Price in Confidence] If price::get_price() is negative, get_magnitude_if_positive() panics at line 30. Does this happen before or after EMA parsing at line 27? Can EMA parsing also panic on negative? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Expo Negative Check Order] The function checks i64::get_is_negative(&expo) first. If expo magnitude retrieval panics on certain edge cases, does the is_negative check prevent it? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Negative Price] EMA price is parsed at line 27 via parse_price_to_decimal(). If EMA price is negative, does it panic before spot price validation, breaking the function? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Caller Assumes Positive] If caller assumes returned Decimal is always positive but doesn't validate, and parse_price_to_decimal somehow returns negative (via decimal module bug), can this cause accounting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Module Visibility] get_pyth_price_and_identifier() is public fun. Can any external module call this with arbitrary PriceInfoObject and Clock, potentially using it to validate malicious prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Private Function] parse_price_to_decimal is 'fun' (private). Can external modules bypass validation by calling get_pyth_price_and_identifier with crafted inputs, then using returned Decimal in unsafe ways? (Low)"
