  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Asset Vault Mispricing] If Volo Vault manages multiple assets with different aggregators, can an attacker create multiple aggregators (legitimate-looking but with loose parameters) for different assets, then exploit relative mispricing to drain the vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Aggregation Inconsistency] If Vault combines multiple aggregators for robust pricing, can an attacker create many aggregators with identical feed_hash but varying parameters, causing the aggregation logic to produce inconsistent or manipulated results? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] If Vault uses oracle prices to enforce loss tolerance per epoch, can stale prices from max_staleness=MAX aggregators show false stability, allowing operations that violate actual loss tolerance limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Asset Mispricing] When Vault adaptors interact with Navi/Suilend/Cetus, can rogue aggregators with min_responses=1 enable single-oracle price manipulation for borrow/supply decisions, causing adaptor operations to extract value from the Vault? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Initial Timestamp Manipulation] clock.timestamp_ms() at line 68 sets initial creation time - if used to calculate data freshness in first update, can an attacker coordinate transaction timing to make initially stale data appear fresh? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Epoch Boundary Creation] If aggregators are created near epoch boundaries with max_staleness set to span multiple epochs, can this cause edge cases where data from previous epoch is accepted as fresh in new epoch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp Zero/Underflow] If clock.timestamp_ms() returns 0 or very small value at line 68, can this cause underflow when calculating staleness (current_time - creation_time < max_staleness) with max_staleness=MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Reentrancy Guard] Entry function at line 81 has no reentrancy protection - if aggregator::new() at line 59 calls back to this module or involves complex transfers, can reentrancy create duplicate aggregators or corrupt state?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Modification During Creation] aggregator::new() at line 59 likely modifies global state - if this function can be called with references to mutable objects, can partially created aggregators cause state inconsistency?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Version Hardcoding] EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1 at line 9 - if queue upgrades to version 2 but this module is not upgraded, can all aggregator creation be DoS'd, preventing new oracle feeds during critical price volatility? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Version Range] Line 37 checks exact version equality - should this accept a range of versions for forward/backward compatibility? Can strict equality cause operational failure during upgrades? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert Without Recovery] All validations use assert! which aborts - should some parameter violations be handled gracefully?

(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Aggregator Limit Per Authority] authority can create unlimited aggregators - can an attacker using a single authority address create millions of aggregators to build reputation then switch to malicious pricing all at once?
