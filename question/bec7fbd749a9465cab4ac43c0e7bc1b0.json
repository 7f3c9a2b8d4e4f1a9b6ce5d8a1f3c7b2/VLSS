  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: dynamic_liquidation_threshold()] [Threshold Retrieval] At line 404, threshold is retrieved from storage. If storage is corrupted or threshold > 100%, does this break the calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: dynamic_liquidation_threshold()] [Oracle Price Staleness] At line 405, user_collateral_value uses oracle prices. If prices are stale across different collateral assets, can this skew threshold calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_collateral_value()] [Value Aggregation] At lines 429-438, collateral values are summed. If oracle prices differ significantly in decimals, can this cause overflow or underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_collateral_value()] [LTV Unused] At line 431, LTV is retrieved but commented out. If future code expects LTV multiplication at line 435, is this a bug waiting to happen? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_collateral_value()] [Zero Collateral] If user has no collateral assets, function returns 0. Can this cause issues in division operations in caller functions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_collateral_value()] [Loop Gas Cost] If user has many collateral assets, does the loop at lines 429-438 consume excessive gas? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_loan_value()] [Loan Value Summation] At lines 451-456, loan values are summed. Can overflow occur if user has massive loans across many assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_loan_value()] [Zero Return Impact] If no loans exist, returns 0. Does caller check for zero before division? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_health_loan_value()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] Each loan asset value is calculated via oracle. Can flash loan price manipulation affect total loan value calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_loan_value()] [Balance Calculation] At line 465, user_loan_balance includes interest. If interest hasn't been updated recently, is value understated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_loan_value()] [Oracle ID Mismatch] At line 466, oracle_id must match the actual asset. Can misconfig cause wrong price to be used? (High)"
