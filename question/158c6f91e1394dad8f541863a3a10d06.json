  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Front-Running] Can admin front-run user deposit transactions by calling set_deposit_fee to increase fee rate, causing users to pay higher fees than expected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Parameter Validation] Does set_deposit_fee validate that new fee doesn't exceed MAX_DEPOSIT_FEE_RATE in underlying vault.set_deposit_fee(), or can overflow/underflow occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Accounting Error] If deposit_fee is changed between request_deposit and execute_deposit, can this cause mismatch in expected vs actual fee deduction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Race Condition] Can set_deposit_fee be called during batch_execute_deposit causing different deposits in same batch to have different fee rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Event Manipulation] Can attacker trigger multiple DepositFeeChanged events to cause off-chain indexer confusion or hide actual fee changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Fee Extraction] Can admin set withdraw_fee to MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_RATE (500bp) immediately before large withdrawals to extract maximum fees from exiting users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Front-Running] Can admin monitor mempool for large withdraw requests and front-run with set_withdraw_fee to increase fees, causing users to receive less principal than expected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Slippage Bypass] If withdraw_fee changes between request_withdraw (expected_amount calculation) and execute_withdraw, can this cause slippage check failure or user receiving less than expected_amount? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Accounting Error] Does set_withdraw_fee properly handle fee change during batch_execute_withdraw, ensuring consistent fee application across all withdrawals in batch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Parameter Validation] Can set_withdraw_fee be called with fee=0 to allow fee-free withdrawals, potentially violating protocol economic model? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [Loss Limit Bypass] Can admin increase loss_tolerance to maximum (10000 = 100%) immediately before risky operations to bypass loss tolerance enforcement? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [Parameter Manipulation] Does set_loss_tolerance validate tolerance <= RATE_SCALING (10000) in manage.move or only in vault.set_loss_tolerance(), allowing potential bypass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [Epoch Attack] If loss_tolerance is changed mid-epoch after losses have already occurred, can this retroactively allow previously invalid operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [Timing Exploit] Can admin set loss_tolerance to 0 immediately after operation ends to prevent future operations, locking funds in vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [State Corruption] Does set_loss_tolerance reset cur_epoch_loss or cur_epoch_loss_base_usd_value, potentially allowing loss limit bypass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_loss_tolerance()] [Front-Running] Can admin front-run end_op_value_update_with_bag by reducing loss_tolerance to cause operation to fail ERR_EXCEED_LOSS_LIMIT check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_cancel_request()] [Lock Bypass] Can admin set locking_time_for_cancel_request to 0 allowing instant request cancellation, bypassing intended cancellation delays? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_cancel_request()] [DoS Attack] Can admin set locking_time_for_cancel_request to maximum u64 value effectively preventing all request cancellations forever? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_cancel_request()] [Retroactive Change] If locking time is increased after users submit requests, can this extend their lock period beyond what they agreed to? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_cancel_request()] [Race Condition] Can user cancel_deposit transaction race with admin set_locking_time_for_cancel_request to exploit timing window? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_withdraw()] [Lock Bypass] Can admin set locking_time_for_withdraw to 0 allowing instant withdrawals after deposits, bypassing intended deposit-withdraw delay? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_withdraw()] [DoS Attack] Can admin set locking_time_for_withdraw to extreme value (e.g., years in milliseconds) effectively locking user funds permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_withdraw()] [Retroactive Lock] If locking time is increased after users deposit, does this retroactively extend their lock period beyond last_deposit_time + original locking_time? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_withdraw()] [Flash Loan Risk] Can attacker exploit 0 locking time to perform flash loan-like attacks: deposit -> manipulate price -> withdraw in same transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_locking_time_for_withdraw()] [Economic Attack] Can malicious admin change locking time to trap depositors when they know vault will suffer losses? (High)"
