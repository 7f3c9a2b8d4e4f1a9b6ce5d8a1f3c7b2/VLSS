  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Concurrent Access] Multiple transactions can call create_lending_market concurrently on the same shared Registry. Could this cause nondeterministic behavior or table corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Shared Object Ownership] Once shared, the Registry has no owner. Could this prevent necessary administrative actions like emergency freezes or market delistings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Admin Cap] The Registry struct has no associated admin capability. Could this prevent protocol governance from managing the registry in emergencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Shared State Mutation] The function mutates shared registry state. Could high contention on popular type parameters cause transaction failures or gas wars? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Lending Market Coupling] The function tightly couples to lending_market::create_lending_market. If that function has vulnerabilities or is upgraded incompatibly, could it break registry functionality? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Module Trust] The registry blindly trusts the lending_market module to return valid objects. Could a malicious or buggy lending_market module return invalid LendingMarket objects that cause downstream issues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Return Value Validation] The (owner_cap, lending_market) tuple is returned without validation. Could corrupt or malformed return values from the lending_market module propagate to callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type Safety] The generic type P must match between registry and lending_market calls. Could type confusion cause markets to be created with incorrect type parameters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Import: lending_market] [Dependency Version] If the lending_market module is upgraded, could breaking changes cause registry operations to fail or behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Gas Cost Attack] Creating a lending market involves multiple operations (UID creation, table insertion, object creation). Could an attacker exploit gas costs to make market creation prohibitively expensive for legitimate users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Storage Cost] Each market creation adds an entry to the table and creates multiple objects. Could repeated calls drain the transaction sender's storage budget? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Size Growth] The lending_markets table can grow indefinitely. Could an attacker create markets for an unbounded number of types, causing the table to become too large to process efficiently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Object Creation Cost] Each call creates a LendingMarket, LendingMarketOwnerCap, and potentially other objects. Could mass market creation strain Sui's object storage system? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [External Call Before State Change] The function calls lending_market::create_lending_market before updating the registry. Could reentrancy in the lending_market module exploit this ordering? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [State Inconsistency Window] Between lending_market creation and table insertion, there's a window where the market exists but isn't registered. Could concurrent transactions exploit this inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Callback Vulnerability] If lending_market::create_lending_market makes callbacks to user-controlled code, could an attacker reenter create_lending_market with the same type parameter? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Table Add Atomicity] The table::add call happens after object creation. If this aborts, are the created objects properly cleaned up or do they leak? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Tuple Return] The function returns (LendingMarketOwnerCap<P>, LendingMarket<P>). If callers don't handle both return values properly, could objects be lost or mishandled? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [OwnerCap Distribution] The LendingMarketOwnerCap is returned to the caller. Could the caller be a malicious contract that immediately misuses or transfers the cap? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [LendingMarket Ownership] The LendingMarket object is returned and must be handled by the caller. If the caller doesn't make it shared or transfer it properly, could it become inaccessible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Usage Validation] The registry doesn't validate how returned objects are used. Could callers create markets but never make them accessible to users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [TypeName Uniqueness] The table uses type_name::get<P>() as the key. Could different type parameters that are semantically different produce the same TypeName? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Phantom Type Usage] P is a phantom type in LendingMarket and LendingMarketOwnerCap. Could phantom type parameters be manipulated to create markets with unexpected properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type Parameter Bounds] There are no trait bounds on the generic type P. Could using capability types, resource types, or other special types as P cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Nested Generics] Could an attacker use nested generic types (e.g., LendingMarket<LendingMarket<T>>) to create confusing or exploitable market hierarchies? (Low)"
