  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Market Value Precision] Do both ctoken_market_value and market_value return values in the same precision/units for correct addition to totals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Reserve Price Usage] Do the market value functions use the same price source that was just validated as fresh, or could they use different/stale prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [PrincipalCoinType Mismatch] Can PrincipalCoinType be different from what the vault expects, causing type confusion in asset retrieval or value updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [ObligationType Validation] Is there runtime validation that ObligationType matches the obligation cap's type, or is this only compile-time checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [First Iteration] On the first iteration of deposits/borrows loop, are total accumulators properly initialized to 0? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Last Iteration] After the last deposit/borrow is processed, is there any cleanup or validation needed before returning? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [Vector Capacity] Is there a maximum size limit on array_indices, and can exceeding it cause errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Compound Before Parse] Is it necessary to call suilend_compound_interest before parse_suilend_obligation, or could parse work correctly with stale interest state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Function Call Order] If the order of compound -> parse -> finish_update is changed, what security implications arise? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Zero Return Semantics] When returning 0, is this distinguishable from genuinely zero-valued positions vs error conditions vs underwater positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Value Validation] Does finish_update_asset_value validate that usd_value is non-negative and within reasonable bounds before accepting it? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Malicious Reserve] If a reserve in the lending_market is compromised or malicious, can it return manipulated market values to steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Reserve Configuration] Can an attacker influence reserve configuration (price feeds, interest rates, decimals) to manipulate obligation valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Intermediate Overflow] Even if final result fits in u256, can intermediate calculations in market_value or to_scaled_val overflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Mul-Div Chain] In the borrowed amount update calculation with mul then div, can the mul overflow before div has a chance to reduce the value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Stale Value Window] Between calculating usd_value and calling finish_update_asset_value, can the actual Suilend position value change significantly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Update Frequency] Can an attacker delay position updates to exploit stale valuations when executing vault operations? (High)"
