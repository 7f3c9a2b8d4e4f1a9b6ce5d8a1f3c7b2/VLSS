  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Overflow Risk] If min_attestations is set to a very high value approaching u64::MAX, could arithmetic operations in queue validation or aggregation logic overflow when multiplying or summing attestation counts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Timestamp Overflow] If oracle_validity_length_ms is near u64::MAX, when added to current timestamps for expiration calculation, could this cause overflow and wrap around to allow expired data to appear fresh? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Key Collision] There's no uniqueness enforcement on queue_key - can an attacker create multiple queues with identical queue_keys, causing ambiguity when other modules try to look up queues by key? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Key Reuse] If a queue is deleted or deactivated, can its queue_key be immediately reused in a new run() call, potentially causing confusion where references to the old queue accidentally point to the new one? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Relationship Validation] No validation ensures min_attestations is reasonable relative to expected guardian count - can setting it higher than available guardians make the queue permanently unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee-Recipient Relationship] No check ensures fee_recipient is different from authority - if they're the same, does this create issues with fee distribution, tax accounting, or incentive alignment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Capability Missing] This is an entry function but requires no capabilities - should queue creation be gated by an AdminCap or ProtocolCap to prevent unauthorized guardian queue proliferation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Return Value] The queue_id is captured for the event but not returned to the caller - does this prevent proper tracking of created queues, making it impossible to reference them later without parsing events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Context Manipulation] The TxContext is passed through to queue::new() - can an attacker manipulate transaction parameters (gas, epoch, sender) to affect queue creation timing or ownership in unintended ways? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Sender Check Missing] No verification that ctx.sender() should be allowed to set the provided authority address - can anyone create queues and assign arbitrary authorities, leading to impersonation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Bootstrap Paradox] This creates THE guardian queue but references a guardian_queue_id of 0x0 - if guardian verification requires a valid guardian queue, how is the first guardian queue validated? Is there a chicken-and-egg problem? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Self-Reference] If this action is meant to create exactly one global guardian queue, what prevents run() from being called multiple times to create competing guardian queues, fragmenting the oracle security model? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Leak] The error constants use descriptive strings - could these leak information about internal validation logic to attackers probing for weaknesses? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Partial Failure] If queue::new() succeeds but event emission somehow fails (though unlikely), would this leave a zombie queue that exists but wasn't announced, causing tracking inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Time Precision] The oracle_validity_length_ms is in milliseconds - if the underlying system uses different time precision (seconds, microseconds), could conversion errors cause off-by-one errors in validity checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Scaling] The fee parameter has no documented unit or scaling - if guardians expect fees in one denomination but this uses another, could this cause fee collection failures or economic exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Integration] If Volo Vault relies on Switchboard guardian queues for price feeds, can an attacker create malicious guardian queues with manipulated parameters (low min_attestations, long validity) to feed bad prices into vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Health Limiter Bypass] If the health limiter depends on oracle prices from guardian queues, can creating a queue with extreme oracle_validity_length_ms allow stale prices to pass validation, enabling unsafe vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vault Dependency] If Volo Vault expects a single canonical guardian queue but run() allows multiple creations, could vaults reference different queues and get inconsistent price data, breaking cross-vault arbitrage assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] Creating guardian queues likely has significant gas cost - can an attacker force the protocol to waste gas by creating many queues that are never used, draining funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Storage Rent] Each queue creation likely incurs storage rent - can spam queue creation cause unsustainable storage costs for the protocol or exhaust storage deposits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Visibility Issue] actuate() is module-private but performs critical operations - if another module in the same package can call it directly, can validation be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Public Function] validate() is public (not entry) - can external modules call it to pre-check parameters and then use that information to craft exploits, or call it repeatedly for reconnaissance? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Minimum Values] Setting both min_attestations and oracle_validity_length_ms to 1 passes validation - does this create a degenerate queue that's technically valid but practically insecure? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Maximum Values] If all u64 parameters are set to u64::MAX simultaneously, could the combination cause unforeseen interactions or overflow in queue logic even if individual parameters are technically valid? (Medium)"
