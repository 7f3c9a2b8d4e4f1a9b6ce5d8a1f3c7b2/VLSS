  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Initialization State] Can run() be called on freshly created oracle before any feeds exist? Could this cause undefined initialization state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Expiration State] After expiration_time_ms passes, does oracle automatically become inactive, or does it require explicit state change? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version State] Version checks prevent upgrades. If queue/oracle must be upgraded, does migration path exist? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Messages] Error constants are human-readable but not machine-parseable. Could error handling in callers be fragile? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Partial Rollback] If actuate() fails after validate() succeeds, are there partial state changes that aren't rolled back? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert vs Return] All validations use assert!() which panics. Should some be recoverable errors for graceful degradation? (Low)",
