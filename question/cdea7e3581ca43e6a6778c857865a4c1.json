  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: version_verification()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass version checks by manipulating the Config.version field through a race condition between version_migrate() calls, allowing operations on outdated protocol logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Access Control] Can version_migrate() be called multiple times by the same StorageAdminCap holder to reset state or cause unexpected behavior through version number manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [State Consistency] If version_migrate() is called while flash loans are active (receipts outstanding), could this lead to receipts becoming invalid or users losing funds when repaying against a migrated config? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: version_verification()] [DoS] Can an attacker front-run legitimate transactions by migrating the version, causing all pending transactions with old version assumptions to fail and revert? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_config()] [Shared Object] Since Config is shared via transfer::share_object(), can multiple configs be created leading to ambiguity about which config controls flash loan operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Duplicate Check] The duplicate check only verifies support_assets table, but if an attacker creates an asset, deletes the support_assets entry, and recreates it with different parameters, could they bypass min/max/rate validations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Table Consistency] After adding to config.assets but before adding to support_assets, if the transaction fails, could this leave an orphaned AssetConfig that's in assets but not in support_assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Rate Validation] The verify_config() checks rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury < FlashLoanMultiple(), but can an attacker set both rates to just below the limit (e.g., 9999 each if multiple is 10000) to extract excessive fees approaching 200%? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Min/Max Validation] Can an admin accidentally or maliciously set min = 0 and max = u64::MAX, allowing flash loans of any size including zero-amount loans that could break fee calculation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Pool ID Collision] If two different asset types point to the same pool_id, could an attacker take a flash loan of AssetA but repay with AssetB, exploiting type confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Fee Calculation] When calculating to_supplier = _loan_amount * rate_to_supplier / FlashLoanMultiple(), if _loan_amount is very large, could this overflow u64 before division, causing a panic or incorrect fee? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Fee Calculation] When calculating to_treasury = _loan_amount * rate_to_treasury / FlashLoanMultiple(), if both values are near u64::MAX, could multiplication overflow before division occurs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Rounding Errors] If _loan_amount * rate_to_supplier is not perfectly divisible by FlashLoanMultiple(), the division rounds down - can an attacker take many small loans to accumulate significant rounding dust that avoids fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Min Amount Bypass] If cfg.min is set to 0, can an attacker take a 0-amount flash loan that generates a receipt but no actual balance, potentially exploiting downstream logic that assumes non-zero amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Max Amount Enforcement] If pool balance is less than cfg.max but an attacker requests cfg.max, will pool::withdraw_balance() panic or return insufficient funds, and could this be used for DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Pool ID Mismatch] The function checks cfg.pool_id == pool_id, but if an admin updates the AssetConfig.pool_id after assets are created, could existing pools become inaccessible while new pools are exploitable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Type Name Spoofing] The function uses type_name::get<CoinType>() for lookup - can an attacker create a malicious CoinType with the same string representation as a legitimate coin to bypass checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Receipt Forgery] The Receipt struct doesn't have any cryptographic binding to the transaction - could an attacker serialize, copy, and reuse a receipt across multiple transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [User Address Manipulation] The Receipt stores _user address, but this is just a parameter - can an attacker specify a different user address to bypass repayment checks or steal from others? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Multiple Loans] Can an attacker call loan() multiple times in the same transaction to obtain multiple receipts and balances, then selectively repay only some to exploit accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Pool Withdraw Failure] If pool::withdraw_balance() fails or returns less than _loan_amount due to insufficient liquidity, is there proper error handling or could this leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [User Validation] The function checks user == _user, but if an attacker can somehow obtain another user's receipt, could they repay on behalf of that user and claim rewards or manipulate accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Pool ID Validation] The function validates pool == pool address, but if pool ownership transfers or pool is deleted between loan() and repay(), could this cause funds to be locked or misdirected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Amount Validation] The assertion repay_amount >= amount + fee_to_supplier + fee_to_treasury uses >=, allowing overpayment - can excess funds be permanently locked in the pool or exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Balance Split] When splitting _repay_balance, if amount + fee_to_supplier + fee_to_treasury overflows u64, could this cause a panic or incorrect split? (High)"
