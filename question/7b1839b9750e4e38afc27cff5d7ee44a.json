  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_ratio()] [Ticket Supply Underflow] If ticket_supply > (total_staked + total_rewards), ratio denominator underflows. Can this occur after mass unstaking where tickets are minted but not yet burned? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_total_active_stake()] [Epoch Cursor Clamping] get_total_active_stake clamps last_active_epoch to current_epoch if staked_update_epoch > current_epoch. How can staked_update_epoch be > current_epoch, and can this break active stake calculation? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: add_total_staked_unsafe()] [Current Epoch Not Found] If staked_update_epoch is far in the past and cur_epoch entry doesn't exist, the function copies old value. Can gap epochs cause total_staked table to have missing entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: sub_total_staked_unsafe()] [Next Epoch Before Current] sub_total_staked_unsafe updates both cur_epoch and next_epoch. Can epoch transition happen between these updates, causing cur_epoch and next_epoch to refer to same epoch and double-subtract? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: add_total_staked_unsafe()] [Epoch Skip] If multiple epochs pass without any stake/unstake, staked_update_epoch stays old. Can this cause ratio to use stale total_staked, enabling arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_ratio()] [Division by Zero] get_ratio calls math::ratio(supply, total_staked + rewards - tickets). If denominator is 0, can this panic and DoS all stake/unstake operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: calculate_unstake_fee()] [Multiplication Overflow] calculate_unstake_fee computes value * base_unstake_fee. If value is near MAX_UINT_64, can overflow cause fee calculation to wrap? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: to_shares()] [Share Calculation Precision] to_shares uses integer division. Can repeated small stakes with rounding down accumulate significant precision loss, allowing attacker to stake without receiving shares? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: from_shares()] [Amount Calculation Precision] from_shares uses integer division. Can attacker burn shares in tiny increments to extract more SUI than entitled via cumulative rounding? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Validator Order Dependency] Unstaking iterates validators in reverse order. Can validator ordering manipulation cause priority validators to be unstaked first, violating intended stake distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Empty Validator List] The function asserts validators length > 0. Can an attacker pass empty validator list to trigger E_NOTHING_TO_UNSTAKE even when unstake should be possible from pending? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Validator Not in Set] If validators list contains address not in validator_set, what happens when validator_set::remove_stakes is called? Can this cause panic or skip unstaking? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: init()] [Initial State] init() creates pool with total_staked[0]=0. Can accessing total_staked before any stakes cause ratio calculation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: init()] [Initial Fees] init() sets base_reward_fee=10%, base_unstake_fee=0.05%. Can these initial values be front-run by an attacker staking before owner adjusts fees? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: init()] [Initial Min Stake] init() sets min_stake=ONE_SUI. Can this be too high for small stakers, causing exclusion? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_staked()] [Event Spoofing] emit_staked is package-level and can be called by any package module. Can an attacker emit fake StakedEvent without actual stake, confusing off-chain indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_unstaked()] [Unstake Event Manipulation] emit_unstaked is package-level. Can attacker emit fake UnstakedEvent to make indexers think pool lost funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_ratio()] [Ratio Event Spam] emit_ratio is package-level. Can attacker spam RatioUpdatedEvent with fake ratios to DoS event listeners? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Dynamic Field Key Collision] mark_cap_created uses vector<u8> key CAP_CREATED. Can other dynamic fields with same key type collide or be removed to bypass cap check? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Exists Check Race] mark_cap_created checks exists then adds field. Can race condition allow two callers to both pass exists check and both add field? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Constant: ONE_SUI] [Minimum Stake Enforcement] ONE_SUI (1e9) is used as min_stake. Can this exclude micro-stakers or cause issues with dust amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Constant: MAX_PERCENT] [Percentage Overflow] MAX_PERCENT is 10000 (100%). If base fees are set to > MAX_PERCENT, can fee calculation overflow or exceed 100%? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Constant: REWARD_UPDATE_DELAY] [Unused Constant] REWARD_UPDATE_DELAY (12h) is defined but update_rewards is deprecated. Can this cause confusion or indicate incomplete migration? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Constant: MAX_UINT_64] [Unused Constant] MAX_UINT_64 is defined but never used in code. Is this intended for overflow checks that are missing? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Error: E_DEPRECATED] [Deprecated Function Trap] E_DEPRECATED (999) is used for all deprecated functions. Can this error code be caught and handled to silently fail deprecated calls? (Low)"
