  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Invariant: Pending Operation Exclusivity] Can multiple pending operations (deposit and withdraw) coexist, violating the assumption that only one operation type is pending at a time? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Invariant: Balance Decrease] Does update_after_execute_deposit() always decrease pending_deposit_balance by exactly executed_deposit_balance, or can partial execution cause inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Invariant: Share Decrease] Can update_after_execute_withdraw() decrease shares and pending_withdraw_shares by different amounts, causing share accounting desynchronization? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker create many reward types to bloat reward_indices and unclaimed_rewards tables, causing update_reward() to consume excessive gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: get_receipt_rewards()] [DoS via Large Vector] If reward_types vector is very large, can iterating through all types and calling get_receipt_reward() for each cause out-of-gas errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Table Lookup Cost] As reward_indices and unclaimed_rewards tables grow, does the cost of contains() and borrow_mut() operations increase, enabling DoS through table pollution? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Event: VaultReceiptInfoUpdated] [Event Replay] Can an attacker replay VaultReceiptInfoUpdated events to confuse off-chain indexers about actual reward distributions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Missing Event Fields] The VaultReceiptInfoUpdated event doesn't include reward_type or receipt identifier—can this cause off-chain systems to misattribute rewards? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Event Emission Condition] VaultReceiptInfoUpdated is only emitted when new_reward_idx > pre_idx—can attackers suppress events by preventing index updates, hiding reward activity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Zero Amount Check] Can pending_deposit_balance=0 be passed to update_after_request_deposit(), and does this allow manipulating status without actual deposit intent? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Zero Share Mint] If new_shares=0 is passed to update_after_execute_deposit(), can a user execute a deposit but receive no shares, causing fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Zero Share Withdrawal] Can pending_withdraw_shares=0 be passed to update_after_request_withdraw() to manipulate status without requesting actual withdrawal? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Zero Claimable Principal] If claimable_principal=0 is passed to update_after_execute_withdraw(), can shares be burned without crediting withdrawable principal, causing fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_deposit()] [Cancel Amount Validation] Does update_after_cancel_deposit() validate that cancelled_deposit_balance <= pending_deposit_balance before subtraction, or can underflow occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_cancel_withdraw()] [Cancel Share Validation] Does update_after_cancel_withdraw() validate that cancelled_withdraw_shares <= pending_withdraw_shares before subtraction, or can underflow occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Reward Index Validation] Does update_reward() validate that new_reward_idx is reasonable (not excessively large), or can overflow in reward calculation occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_shares()] [Test Function in Production] Is set_shares() guarded by #[test_only], and if accidentally included in production, can it be exploited to arbitrarily manipulate shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_status()] [Status Bypass] If set_status() is not properly guarded by #[test_only], can an attacker call it to bypass status transition logic and set arbitrary status values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_pending_withdraw_shares()] [Direct Manipulation] Can set_pending_withdraw_shares() be exploited if not properly test-only guarded to bypass withdrawal request validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_claimable_principal()] [Principal Inflation] If set_claimable_principal() is accessible in production, can an attacker inflate their claimable principal without executing valid withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_pending_deposit_balance()] [Deposit Manipulation] Can set_pending_deposit_balance() be used to bypass deposit limits if test guards are not properly enforced? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: add_share()] [Share Minting] Can add_share() be called in production to mint shares without corresponding deposits, inflating total supply? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: decrease_share()] [Share Burning] Can decrease_share() be used to burn shares without proper withdrawal, allowing an attacker to manipulate share-to-asset ratios? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_last_deposit_time()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can set_last_deposit_time() be exploited to bypass locking windows if test-only guards fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [vault_utils Dependency] Can vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() be manipulated through oracle price feeds to inflate acc_reward calculation? (High)"
