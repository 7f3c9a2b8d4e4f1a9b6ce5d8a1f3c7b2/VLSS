  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Struct: ReserveConfigBuilder] [Bag Storage] The builder stores all fields in a Bag rather than as struct fields - this allows dynamic field addition. Can an attacker exploit this to inject unexpected fields that cause panics in build()? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: create_reserve_config()] [Validation Timing] The function creates a ReserveConfig struct and then validates it - if validation fails, the struct is already created in memory. Can this cause resource leaks or enable partial config creation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Isolation Enforcement] For isolated reserves, the validation enforces open_ltv_pct == 0 && close_ltv_pct == 0 - but does not check if borrow_weight_bps is also appropriately high. Can isolated assets have low borrow weights, making them appear safer than they are? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Attributed Limits] The validation ensures open_attributed_borrow_limit_usd <= close_attributed_borrow_limit_usd, but these fields are marked unused - if they become used in future versions, could their current validation be insufficient? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [APR Bounds] The function validates the structure of interest rate curves but does not enforce maximum APR values - can aprs contain values like 1_000_000 BPS (10,000% APR), causing integer overflow in interest accrual? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Module: decimal] [Import Dependencies] The module imports decimal operations (add, sub, mul, div, ge, le) - if the decimal module has precision loss or overflow issues, all calculations in reserve_config inherit these bugs. Has the decimal module been audited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Decimal Operations] The function performs sub(cur_util, left_util) without checking if cur_util < left_util - can negative Decimal values be represented, and if so, do they break the division in weight calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Decimal Comparison] The function uses ge() and le() for Decimal comparison - are these comparisons exact or do they have a tolerance? If tolerance exists, can utilization near boundaries (e.g., 79.999% vs 80%) be misclassified? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_supply_apr()] [Decimal Subtraction] The calculation sub(decimal::from(1), spread_fee) assumes spread_fee <= 1.0 - but the validation only checks spread_fee_bps <= 10_000. If from_bps() incorrectly converts 10_000 BPS to >1.0, can subtraction fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [Config Mutability] The ReserveConfig struct has no update functions in this module - if the lending protocol provides update functions, can config fields be changed without revalidation, breaking invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [LTV Enforcement] The config provides open_ltv() and close_ltv() functions - if the lending protocol calls these incorrectly (e.g., using open_ltv for liquidation checks instead of close_ltv), can healthy positions be liquidated? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [Limit Enforcement] The config provides deposit_limit() and borrow_limit() - if these limits are not enforced in the actual deposit/borrow functions, they serve no purpose. How is limit enforcement guaranteed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [Fee Collection] The config specifies borrow_fee() and spread_fee() - if these fees are calculated but not properly collected in the lending protocol, can borrowers avoid fees or can protocol revenue be lost? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [APR Updates] The calculate_apr() function depends on current utilization - if utilization is calculated incorrectly in the lending protocol (e.g., stale values), can borrowers face incorrect interest rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [External Usage] [Isolation Mode] The isolated() getter returns a bool - if the lending protocol does not properly check this flag before allowing collateral usage, can isolated assets be used as collateral despite restrictions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: create_reserve_config()] [Zero Limits] Can deposit_limit or borrow_limit be set to 0, effectively disabling deposits or borrows for this reserve? If so, can this be used to lock funds already deposited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: create_reserve_config()] [Zero LTV] Can open_ltv_pct and close_ltv_pct both be 0 for non-isolated assets, preventing any borrowing against them? Is this intentional or a DoS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Maximum Values] Can borrow_weight_bps be set to u64::MAX, causing multiplication overflow when calculating weighted borrow amounts in the lending protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Fee Sum] The sum liquidation_bonus_bps + protocol_liquidation_fee_bps must be <= 2_000 (20%) - but what if liquidation_bonus_bps alone is 2_000 and protocol_liquidation_fee_bps is 0? Can liquidators receive 20% bonus with no protocol fee, disincentivizing protocol sustainability? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Utilization = 0] If cur_util is exactly 0 (0% utilization), the function should return the APR at utils[0] - but if the first interval check fails due to precision, can this cause the unreachable assertion to trigger? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Utilization = 1] If cur_util is exactly 1.0 (100% utilization), the function should return the APR at utils[length-1] - but the assertion only checks cur_util <= 1.0, not cur_util < 1.0. Can utilization > 100% occur in the lending protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_supply_apr()] [Zero Utilization] If cur_util is 0, supply APR becomes 0 regardless of borrow APR - this is mathematically correct, but can this create scenarios where initial depositors receive no yield, discouraging bootstrap liquidity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: build()] [Reentrancy] The build() function performs multiple bag::remove() operations - if bag operations can be re-entered (e.g., through custom drop implementations), can an attacker manipulate the builder state mid-execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: set()] [Race Condition] The set() function checks if a key exists and either updates or adds - in a concurrent execution environment, can two transactions race to set the same key, causing one update to be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: from()] [Shared Reference] The from() function takes &ReserveConfig and creates a builder - if the original config is modified while the builder is being constructed (in a concurrent context), can the builder end up with inconsistent state? (Low)"
