(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_collateral_value()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker populate their collaterals vector with hundreds of assets, causing the while loop at lines 95-105 to consume excessive gas and DoS the health factor calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_collateral_value()] [Uninitialized Variable] If the while loop at lines 95-105 never executes (len=0), the function returns value=0 initialized at line 84 - can this cause users with no collateral assets to have zero health collateral, enabling improper liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_collateral_value()] [Index Out of Bounds] Can vector::borrow() at line 96 panic if the collaterals vector is modified between line 82 and the loop, causing DoS for health calculations?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Vector Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the vector::contains() check at line 124 by having duplicate loan assets in storage, causing their debt to be counted multiple times and triggering false liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Vector Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the loans vector to exclude their actual borrowed assets, causing vector::push_back() at line 126 to add it but the existing debt not being counted, understating total loan value?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Integer Overflow] Can the value accumulation at line 141 overflow when summing multiple large loan_value amounts, wrapping to a small number and making an overleveraged attacker appear safe from liquidation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Logic Error] Can an attacker exploit is_increase=true at line 125 to push their asset into the local loans vector 'l' at line 126, but since it's local, future calls won't see it, causing inconsistent loan value calculations across transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Off-by-One] Can the len increment at line 127 cause the while loop at line 132 to read beyond the vector bounds, causing a panic or returning invalid loan data?

(High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Storage Race Condition] Since storage is &mut at line 112, can concurrent operations mutate the loans vector between line 118 and the loop at lines 132-143, causing inconsistent loan calculations?
