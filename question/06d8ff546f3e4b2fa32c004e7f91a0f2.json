  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Struct: IncentivePool] [Index Paid Tracking] index_rewards_paids at line 59 stores u256 per user; could large number of users cause table operations to become prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Pool Vector Growth] pool_objs at line 39 grows unboundedly; if 10,000 pools created, could iteration in update_reward become DOS vector? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Inactive Vector] inactive_objs at line 40 never shrinks; could repeated freeze operations accumulate thousands of inactive pool addresses? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Function: calculate_user_effective_amount()] [Balance Precision] User balances are u256 but may represent different decimals; could decimal mismatch cause incorrect effective amount calculation? (High)",
