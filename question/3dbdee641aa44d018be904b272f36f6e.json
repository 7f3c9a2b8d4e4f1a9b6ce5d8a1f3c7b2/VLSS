  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Admin Censorship] Can OracleAdminCap holder refuse to register legitimate tokens, creating oracle monopolies or excluding competing protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Friend Module Exploit] Can malicious friend modules (oracle_pro/oracle_manage) call update_price() to inject arbitrary prices without OracleFeederCap, bypassing intended price feed controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Event Manipulation] PriceUpdated event emits old and new prices, but can friend modules emit misleading events by calling update_price() with prices that don't reflect actual market conditions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [No Price Validation] update_price() accepts any token_price value without bounds checking, can this be exploited to set prices to 0 or u256::MAX to break dependent protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Timestamp Race] If multiple friend modules call update_price() for the same oracle_id in quick succession, can timestamp ordering be violated due to clock granularity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Price Flash Attack] Can update_price() be called twice in the same transaction (once with manipulated price, once with recovery) with only the final price persisting but both events emitted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Oracle ID Validation] Does update_price() properly handle edge case oracle_ids (0, 255) or can these cause table lookup errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Missing Event Emission] Unlike update_price(), update_token_price() doesn't emit PriceUpdated events, making feeder updates invisible to monitoring systems? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Price Manipulation] Can OracleFeederCap holder set token_price to 0 to DoS price-dependent operations, or to u256::MAX to cause overflow in vault calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Stale Price Attack] Can feeder update prices with timestamp_ms from clock but intentionally set outdated prices, passing staleness checks while providing incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [No Rate Limiting] Can OracleFeederCap holder spam update_token_price() with rapid updates to cause storage writes exhaustion or prevent other transactions from processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Decimal Immutability] Price decimal is set during registration and never updated, can this cause issues if token economics change requiring decimal adjustment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Timestamp Monotonicity] Is there a check ensuring new timestamp > old timestamp, or can feeders update with past timestamps to manipulate staleness windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Partial Update Failure] If update_token_price() aborts for one oracle_id mid-batch, do all prior updates in the batch get reverted or do some persist causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Length Mismatch DoS] The assertion checks vector lengths match, but can an attacker pass empty vectors to bypass updates or very large vectors to cause gas exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Duplicate Oracle IDs] Can oracle_ids vector contain duplicates, causing the same price to be updated multiple times with different values, with only the last update persisting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Timestamp Atomicity] All prices in batch get the same timestamp from clock, can this be exploited to make prices appear simultaneously fresh when they were fetched at different times? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [No Event Batching] Batch updates call update_token_price() which doesn't emit events, making it impossible to audit which prices changed in a batch operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Index Bounds] While loop uses vector::borrow without explicit bounds checking, can optimized compilation cause out-of-bounds access if len calculation is manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Gas Griefing] Can feeder submit batch with maximum vector length to consume excessive gas, preventing other urgent transactions from executing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Staleness Window Edge Case] The staleness check uses current_ts - timestamp <= update_interval, can timestamp equal to current_ts + 1 due to clock drift cause underflow in subtraction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Zero Price Valid] The validity logic checks value > 0 AND staleness, but can a price of 1 wei with correct staleness be considered valid despite being economically meaningless? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Update Interval Race] If update_interval is changed via set_update_interval() during get_token_price() execution, which interval value is used for staleness calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Future Timestamp Attack] If price.timestamp is somehow set to a future value, can current_ts - timestamp cause underflow, incorrectly marking the price as valid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Boolean Return Abuse] Function returns (bool, u256, u8) with valid flag, but can callers ignore the valid flag and use stale prices causing incorrect valuations? (High)"
