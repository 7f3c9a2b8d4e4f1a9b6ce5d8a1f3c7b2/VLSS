  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Pyth Oracle] Can an attacker provide a manipulated PriceInfoObject that has outdated or fabricated price data but appears valid to the adaptor checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle Type Mismatch] If the feed is configured for Pyth but Supra objects are passed (or vice versa), can type confusion in get_price_from_adaptor return default/garbage values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle Reference Validation] Does the function verify that the supra_oracle_holder and pyth_price_info objects actually correspond to the requested feed_address, or can mismatched oracles be provided? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Config Mutation] Can the oracle_config be modified by another transaction between version_verification and later config reads, causing inconsistent state during price calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [PriceOracle Mutation] Can the price_oracle object be modified concurrently, causing safe_decimal to return different values mid-execution, breaking decimal consistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Feed Config Updates] If price feed configuration is updated mid-execution (e.g., max_timestamp_diff changed), can this cause inconsistent validation where old parameters are used for some checks and new for others? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle ID] Can oracle_id retrieved from the feed be stale or incorrect if the feed was recently updated, causing wrong decimal retrieval from price_oracle? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Success Return] When returning (constants::success(), final_price), can final_price be 0 legitimately for some assets, making it indistinguishable from error returns? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [U256 Overflow] Can final_price reach u256::MAX through legitimate operations, and would this cause downstream overflow when multiplied by asset amounts in vault calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Type Safety] Since final_price is u256, can caller contracts that expect smaller integer types experience truncation or overflow when casting the returned value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Freshness Strategy] Can is_oracle_price_fresh in the strategy module have incorrect logic that accepts stale prices or rejects fresh ones based on flawed timestamp comparison? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Validation Strategy] Can validate_price_difference in strategy module be exploited through integer overflow when calculating percentage differences between primary and secondary prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Range Strategy] Can validate_price_range_and_history in strategy module accept prices outside safe ranges due to incorrect boundary checks or percentage calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Vault Integration] Can vault operations calling this function be front-run by attackers who manipulate oracle prices just before the vault transaction executes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Multi-Asset Vault] If vault queries multiple feed_addresses in sequence, can an attacker exploit timing windows between calls to arbitrage price inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Health Limiter] Can the health limiter adaptor be bypassed if it relies on prices from this function but doesn't properly validate error codes, accepting zero prices as valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Cross-Protocol] Can external DeFi protocols (Navi, Suilend, Cetus) that use these prices be exploited if they have different staleness tolerances or validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Reentrancy] Can this function be reentered through oracle adaptor callbacks, potentially causing state inconsistencies in the strategy module's validation state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Concurrent Calls] Can multiple concurrent calls with the same feed_address race in the strategy module's timer/threshold tracking, causing incorrect severity assessments? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [State Mutations] Does the function read from or write to any shared mutable state that could be corrupted by concurrent executions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Zero Timestamp] Can current_timestamp from Clock be 0 at genesis or in test environments, causing all freshness checks to fail or pass incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Future Timestamp] Can updated_time from oracles be in the future (due to clock skew), causing timestamp difference calculations to underflow and wrap to large values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Max Values] If any configuration parameter (max_timestamp_diff, thresholds, etc.) is set to maximum u64/u256, can this cause overflow in subsequent calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Zero Decimal] If safe_decimal returns 0, can division by zero occur in price normalization within get_price_from_adaptor? (Critical)",
