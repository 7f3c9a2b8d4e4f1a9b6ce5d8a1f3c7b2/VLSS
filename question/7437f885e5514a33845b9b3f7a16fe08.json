  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message] EOracleKeyExists at line 10 is the error for duplicate keys - is this error message sufficient for users to understand which oracle_key conflicted, or can it cause confusion in multi-oracle systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message] EInvalidQueueVersion at line 12 doesn't include the actual vs expected version - can users diagnose version mismatches without additional context? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Partial Failure] If validate() passes but actuate() fails (e.g., oracle::new aborts), is there proper error propagation, or can users be left in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue State] The validate function reads queue.version() and queue.existing_oracles_contains() - can stale Queue state be passed if the Queue is modified in a previous transaction in the same PTB? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Mutation] The actuate function mutates Queue via add_existing_oracle - can this violate Queue invariants if called from an unexpected context or with a malformed Queue reference? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Methods] The code calls queue.id(), queue.queue_key(), and queue.add_existing_oracle() - are these guaranteed to be atomic, or can queue state change mid-execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Creation] The oracle::new call is package-scoped based on the dependency - can this prevent unauthorized oracle creation, or can other packages with switchboard dependency also call oracle::new? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Sharing] The oracle::new function shares the Oracle object - can this create a race where the Oracle is modified by another transaction before add_existing_oracle completes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Lifecycle] The created Oracle is shared but never transferred to a specific owner - can this lead to ownership ambiguity or unauthorized oracle modifications? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Null Input] The oracle_key parameter can be an empty vector - does validate() properly reject empty keys, or can empty-key oracles be created, causing resolution failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Reference] The queue parameter is &mut Queue - can a malicious caller pass a fake Queue object with manipulated version/existing_oracles to bypass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Reference Semantics] The validate function takes &vector<u8> for oracle_key - can the vector be modified between validate() and actuate() in the same transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Spam Attack] With no rate limiting or cost enforcement, can an attacker create thousands of oracles to exhaust Queue storage or make oracle lookup operations expensive? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] The run() function performs table lookup, object creation, table insertion, and event emission - can the cumulative gas cost be used to grief users attempting legitimate oracle creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Table Growth] Unbounded add_existing_oracle calls can grow the existing_oracles table - is there a maximum queue size check to prevent table overflow DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Struct: OracleCreated] [Type Binding] The OracleCreated event has copy, drop capabilities - can event data be modified or dropped unexpectedly, causing event indexing inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Type] The Queue parameter lacks generic type bounds - can this function be called with incompatible Queue versions or fake Queue structs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Module: oracle_init_action] [Import Safety] The module imports switchboard::queue and switchboard::oracle - can circular dependencies or version mismatches between these modules cause runtime failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Atomicity] The run() function calls validate then actuate sequentially - can a transaction abort after validation but before actuation, leaving inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Multi-Step] The actuate function performs oracle creation, queue mutation, and event emission - if any step fails, are previous steps rolled back, or can partial state changes persist? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Rollback Safety] If add_existing_oracle at line 39 fails due to key collision, is the Oracle created at line 33 properly destroyed, or does it remain as an orphaned shared object? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Zero Version] If queue.version() returns 0 (uninitialized), will the check at line 24 fail even though the queue might be valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [ID Collision] Can oracle::new return an oracle_id that's already in use by another object, causing ID collision in the global object store? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Max Oracles] Is there an upper limit on oracles per queue, or can unbounded oracle creation via run() cause table size to exceed Sui's limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [PTB Sequencing] In a PTB with multiple run() calls for the same Queue, can later calls fail due to state changes from earlier calls in the same block? (Medium)"
