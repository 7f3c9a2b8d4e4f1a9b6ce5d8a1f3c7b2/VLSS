  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_reserve()] [Reserve Limit] No limit on number of reserves - can attacker add unlimited reserves to DoS operations that iterate over all reserves? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_reserve()] [Duplicate Check] Checks reserve_array_index == vector::length() to prevent duplicates but this only checks type - can same type with different price feeds or configs be added? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: update_reserve_config()] [Config Update] Owner can update config at any time with no validation - can sudden parameter changes (like fee rates, LTV) cause unexpected liquidations or insolvencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: compound_interest()] [Interest Calculation] Public function allows anyone to compound interest - can attacker repeatedly call to manipulate ctoken ratios via rounding errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_liquidity_and_mint_ctokens()] [Interest Timing] Compounds interest before minting ctokens - can attacker front-run deposits to capture interest via ctoken ratio manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: redeem_ctokens_and_withdraw_liquidity_request()] [Interest Before Redeem] Compounds interest before redeeming - does this benefit or harm redeemer if significant time passed since last compound? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Lines: 241-243] [Reserve Type Check] Asserts reserve::coin_type(reserve) == type_name::get<T>() but this happens after borrowing mut reserve - can wrong index access wrong reserve briefly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Lines: 298-301] [Type Check After Compound] Gets reserve mut, checks type, then compounds - should type check happen first to avoid compounding wrong reserve on error? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_pool_reward()] [Reward Period] No validation that start_time_ms < end_time_ms or that times are in future - can owner create invalid reward periods causing claim failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_pool_reward()] [Reward Amount] No validation that reward amount is > 0 or matches expected distribution rate - can 0-amount or dust rewards waste storage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: cancel_pool_reward()] [Cancellation Timing] No check when reward can be cancelled (could be during active period) - can owner cancel active rewards to prevent users from claiming? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: close_pool_reward()] [Close vs Cancel] Both return unallocated_rewards but close presumably requires period ended - is there validation difference that could be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Cap Requirement] Requires ObligationOwnerCap so only owner can claim - but claim_rewards_and_deposit is permissionless - can griefer claim and deposit rewards to prevent owner from withdrawing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Repay Priority] If borrowed_amount > 0, repays before depositing - can attacker manipulate borrowed_amount to redirect user rewards to debt repayment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Expected CTokens] If expected_ctokens == 0, joins rewards to reserve fees - can this be exploited to donate user rewards to protocol via ctoken_ratio manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_by_obligation_id()] [Blacklist Check] Prevents claiming specific SUILEND_POINT_2 type but uses string comparison - can attacker deploy similar type with different address to bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_by_obligation_id()] [Reward Period Check] Only checks fail_if_reward_period_not_over flag when true - can rewards be claimed before period ends in normal path? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Lines: 1282-1290] [Period Validation] Checks clock >= end_time_ms when fail_if_reward_period_not_over is true but doesn't validate start_time_ms - can rewards be claimed before period starts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Receivers Length] Requires receivers.length == weights.length and > 0 but no upper bound - can owner set thousands of receivers to DoS fee claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Weight Validation] Checks total_weight > 0 but doesn't check individual weights - can 0-weight receivers cause unintended behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Dynamic Field Replace] Removes old FeeReceivers and adds new without refunding accumulated fees - can owner change receivers to prevent claiming accumulated fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Entry Function] Marked as entry so publicly callable - anyone can trigger fee distribution potentially at inopportune times for gas or front-running reasons? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Fee Distribution] Last receiver gets withdraw_all() for both ctoken_fees and fees - if earlier distributions round down, last receiver captures all rounding dust - is this fair? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Zero Balance Handling] Checks balance > 0 before transfer but still creates coin - can 0-balance coins cause issues in receiver wallets? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Reentrancy] Transfers coins to each receiver in loop - can malicious receiver reenter to double-claim if transfer triggers hooks? (Medium)"
