  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: init()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker front-run the init() function deployment to steal OwnerCap and StorageAdminCap by monitoring mempool and submitting a competing transaction with higher gas, gaining complete control over all reserve configurations and pause mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: init()] [Centralization Risk] Does transferring both OwnerCap and StorageAdminCap to the same sender address create a single point of failure where compromise of one account grants both admin and owner privileges, violating separation of duties for treasury withdrawal and parameter updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 24-30] [Capability Security] Can OwnerCap or StorageAdminCap be duplicated, transferred to unauthorized addresses, or stored in a way that allows multiple parties to hold them simultaneously, breaking the single-authority assumption for critical operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Authorization Escalation] If OwnerCap is compromised, can an attacker set paused=true permanently and then destroy or hide the cap, creating an irreversible DoS where all protocol operations are frozen with no recovery path? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_supply_cap()] [Missing Pause Check] Can set_supply_cap() be called while storage.paused=true to modify supply caps during emergency pause, bypassing the intended freeze of all parameter changes and allowing manipulation during crisis situations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_borrow_cap()] [Missing Pause Check] Can set_borrow_cap() modify borrow_cap_ceiling while paused=true, enabling an attacker with OwnerCap to raise borrow limits during pause and then unpause to allow massive over-borrowing before monitoring systems react? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_ltv()] [Missing Pause Check] Can set_ltv() change loan-to-value ratios while protocol is paused, allowing OwnerCap holder to increase LTV during pause and immediately trigger liquidations when unpaused, front-running users who cannot react? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_treasury_factor()] [Missing Pause Check] Can treasury_factor be modified via set_treasury_factor() during pause state, allowing manipulation of fee collection rates when users cannot withdraw or adjust positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_ratio()] [Missing Pause Check] Can liquidation_ratio be changed while paused=true, enabling adjustment of liquidation thresholds when price oracles are potentially stale or unreliable during emergency conditions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_bonus()] [Missing Pause Check] Can liquidation_bonus be increased during pause to maximize liquidator profits at borrower expense, with changes taking effect immediately upon unpause before users can react? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_threshold()] [Missing Pause Check] Can liquidation_threshold be lowered while protocol is paused, setting up mass liquidation events that trigger immediately when operations resume? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 468-474] [Friend Function Security] Can malicious or compromised lending_core::logic or lending_core::flash_loan modules call update_interest_rate() to set arbitrary rates (new_borrow_rate, new_supply_rate) without validation, manipulating yields to drain protocol value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 477-493] [Friend Function Security] Can lending_core::flash_loan module call update_state() to set manipulated borrow/supply indexes or add fake scaled_treasury_amount, inflating treasury balance without actual fees collected? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 495-504] [Friend Function Security] Can increase_balance_for_pool() be called by friend modules with arbitrary in_supply and in_borrow values to inflate total_supply without corresponding user deposits, breaking accounting invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 506-513] [Friend Function Security] Can increase_supply_balance() be exploited by friend modules to credit arbitrary amounts to chosen users without actual deposits, enabling theft from the pool? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 515-522] [Friend Function Security] Can decrease_supply_balance() be called to drain any user's supply balance to zero, combined with increase_supply_balance() to their own address for balance transfer attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 524-531] [Friend Function Security] Can increase_borrow_balance() be used by compromised friend module to assign debt to innocent users without them receiving borrowed funds, socializing losses unfairly? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 533-540] [Friend Function Security] Can decrease_borrow_balance() be exploited to forgive debt of colluding borrowers without repayment, draining protocol reserves through unpaid loans? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Authorization Split] Does requiring both StorageAdminCap and PoolAdminCap for treasury withdrawal create upgrade risks where one cap is upgraded but the other isn't, causing treasury funds to become permanently locked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: when_not_paused()] [Logic Error] Does when_not_paused() only check pause status without enforcing it in all state-changing functions, creating bypass paths where critical operations proceed despite pause=true? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Event Replay] Can Paused event emissions be replayed or spoofed by monitoring systems to create false alerts, causing operational confusion about actual protocol status? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: when_not_paused()] [Missing Integration] Are friend functions (update_interest_rate, update_state, balance operations) missing when_not_paused() checks, allowing lending_core::logic to continue operations during emergency pause? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [State Race] Can set_pause(true) be called simultaneously with friend function balance updates, creating race condition where some updates complete after pause flag is set but before when_not_paused() checks occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: pause()] [View Function Security] Does exposing pause status via public pause() function allow attackers to time-based attacks by monitoring pause state transitions and front-running unpause operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Migration Race] Can version_migrate() be called multiple times in rapid succession before version field updates, causing version to skip ahead beyond this_version() and breaking version_verification() checks? (High)"
