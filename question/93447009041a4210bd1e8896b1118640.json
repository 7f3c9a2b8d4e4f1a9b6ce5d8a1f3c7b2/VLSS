  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Gas Limit Attack] With many reserves (high reserves_count), the function makes 13+ storage getter calls per reserve - can this cause out-of-gas errors preventing legitimate data retrieval? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Data Atomicity] The function makes multiple separate calls to storage getters - can state changes between these calls create an inconsistent ReserveDataInfo struct that violates protocol invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Loop Invariant] The while loop iterates from length-1 down to 0 - can the loop be interrupted or manipulated to skip certain reserves, hiding problem reserves from monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Vector Capacity] The function builds a vector of ReserveDataInfo with 25 fields each - can this cause memory issues if reserves_count is very large (e.g., 1000+ reserves)? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Mutable Reference Pattern] Two of three functions take mutable Storage references but only read - is this an anti-pattern that violates Move's reference semantics and could enable unexpected behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Access Control] All three functions are public with no access restrictions - should certain data like user balances or reserve configurations be restricted to prevent information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Data Consistency Across Functions] If get_oracle_info and get_reserve_data are called sequentially, can oracle prices change between calls, causing valuation inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Missing Event Emissions] None of the getter functions emit events - should data access be logged to detect scraping or front-running activity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [No Return Value Validation] The functions return data structs without validating the data - can invalid/corrupted storage data be returned unchecked, propagating errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Struct Copy Overhead] All return structs have `copy, drop` abilities and are returned by value - can large vector returns (many reserves/users) cause excessive memory copying? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Missing Input Validation] None of the functions validate their inputs (oracle IDs, user address, storage reference) - can invalid inputs cause runtime aborts or expose internal errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Timestamp Dependency] get_oracle_info depends on Clock while get_user_state and get_reserve_data don't - can this create timing inconsistencies in combined queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Storage Reference Lifetime] The functions borrow Storage references during execution - can long-running getter calls block other transactions needing Storage access? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [No Pagination] All functions return complete datasets without pagination - can this cause transaction failures when returning data for protocols with hundreds of reserves or oracle IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [External Module Trust] The module depends on oracle::oracle and lending_core::storage modules - can compromised external modules return malicious data through these getters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Type Safety] All numeric values use u256 or u64 - can type conversions between these during calculations cause precision loss or overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Missing Error Handling] No explicit error handling or assertions in any function - can failures in storage getters cause silent data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [UI Integration Risk] The module is named 'lending_ui' suggesting it's for UI consumption - can UI-specific data formatting create vulnerabilities if used for core protocol logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Vector Iteration] The loop decrements length and accesses length-1 - can the first iteration access an invalid index if vector indexing is 0-based but length-1 equals vector.length-1? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Price Decimal Mismatch] Different oracle IDs may have different decimal formats (6, 8, 9, 18) - can mixing oracle prices without normalization cause calculation errors in vault value computations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Zero Balance Handling] The function returns UserStateInfo even for reserves where user has zero balance - can this cause unnecessary gas costs or confusion when processing users with positions in only a few reserves? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Balance Index Precision] If storage::get_user_balance returns indexed balances (balance * index), can failures to divide by index in consuming code cause massive balance inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Cap Configuration] The function returns both supply_cap and borrow_cap - can misconfigured caps (borrow_cap > supply_cap) indicate protocol insolvency risks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Rate Model Manipulation] If an attacker can manipulate utilization to exceed optimal_utilization, can they force the protocol into the jump rate multiplier region, causing excessive borrow rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Liquidation Parameter Ordering] The liquidation parameters (ratio, bonus, threshold) are stored separately - can incorrect ordering or value relationships (e.g., threshold < ratio) break liquidation logic? (Critical)"
