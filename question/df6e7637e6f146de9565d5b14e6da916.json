(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_health_factor()] [Arithmetic Overflow] When ray_math::ray_div(dynamic_health_collateral_value, dynamic_health_loan_value) is called with very large collateral values, can this overflow the u256 type and wrap around to produce an artificially low health factor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_health_factor()] [Logic Error] The assertion at line 24 prevents both estimate_supply_value > 0 AND estimate_borrow_value > 0, but what if a user wants to simultaneously supply and borrow in a single transaction - does this block legitimate use cases?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_health_factor()] [Edge Case] If dynamic_liquidation_threshold returns 0 because collateral_value is 0 in that function, the health factor becomes 0 regardless of loan value - can this incorrectly trigger liquidations?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/calculate.move] [Function: dynamic_health_factor()] [Return Value Manipulation] When dynamic_health_loan_value is 0, returning address::max() (line 69) represents infinite health - can this be exploited in liquidation logic that uses health factor thresholds?
