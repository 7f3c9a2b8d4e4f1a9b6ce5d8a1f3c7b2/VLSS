  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vault Price Dependency] Actuate updates aggregator used by Volo Vault for pricing. If malicious oracle submits price right before vault operation, could this enable sandwich attacks on vault deposits/withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: run()] [Price Feed Manipulation Timing] Entry function is publicly callable. Could attacker observe pending vault operations and front-run with manipulated price submissions to profit from vault mispricing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Multi-Oracle Collusion] If vault relies on aggregator and min_responses is low, could colluding oracles submit coordinated false prices within variance bounds to manipulate vault asset valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Lines: 13-14] [Version Hardcoding] EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION and EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION are hardcoded to 1. If versions need upgrade, is there migration path or would this break all existing deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Lines: 16-33] [Error Code Collision] Multiple error constants defined. Could error code collisions with other modules cause confusion in debugging or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Aggregator State] Validation doesn't check if aggregator is paused or disabled. Could updates continue on disabled aggregators causing stale data propagation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Value Bounds] No validation that submitted value is within reasonable bounds for asset type. Could extreme values (e.g., 1e100 for SUI price) cause downstream calculation failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Rate Limiting] No check on submission frequency per oracle. Could single oracle spam updates within staleness window causing computational DoS or event spam? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Duplicate Prevention] No check preventing exact same (value, timestamp, oracle) tuple from being submitted multiple times causing redundant storage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State-Event-Transfer Order] Line 112 mutates state, line 123 emits event, line 120 transfers fee. If transfer fails, are state and event rolled back atomically? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Before Transfer] Event emitted at line 123 before fee transfer at line 120. Could observers act on event while transfer fails causing inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Compressed Key Format] Line 83 recovers compressed pubkey. Could invalid compressed points bypass validation if decompression doesn't fail safely at line 88? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Decompressed Key Length] After decompression at line 88, is recovered_pubkey length validated before check_subvec at line 91? Could short/long keys cause out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Key Format Mismatch] oracle.secp256k1_key() format compared with decompressed key at line 91. If oracle stores compressed format, would comparison fail for all valid signatures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Update Message Prefix] Does hash::generate_update_msg include proper prefix/domain separator? Without it, could signatures be replayed from other contexts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Message Component Order] Lines 72-80 pass 7 parameters to generate_update_msg. If order is not canonical, could rearranged parameters produce same hash enabling signature confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Hash Collision] If hash::generate_update_msg uses weak hashing, could attacker find collision where different (value, timestamp) pairs produce same hash for replay? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Result Deduplication] add_result at lines 112-117 may not deduplicate. Could submitting same result multiple times skew aggregation math toward attacker-favorable price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Result Pruning] Does add_result bound result history size? Without pruning, could unbounded growth cause storage exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
