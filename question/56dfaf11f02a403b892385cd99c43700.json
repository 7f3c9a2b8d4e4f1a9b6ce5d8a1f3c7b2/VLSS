  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker provide duplicate oracle IDs in the `ids` vector to cause price data inconsistency or manipulation, where the same oracle is queried multiple times potentially at different timestamps within the same call? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Integer Underflow] In the while loop condition `length > 0` with `length = length - 1`, can an empty `ids` vector cause `length` to underflow when borrowing at `length - 1` since vector::length returns 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Index Out of Bounds] When accessing `vector::borrow(&ids, length - 1)`, if the ids vector is empty (length=0), does the borrow at index -1 (wrapped to max u64) cause a runtime abort or exploitable behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Price Staleness] The function retrieves oracle prices via `oracle::get_token_price()` but returns all results including potentially stale/invalid prices marked by `valid: bool` - can downstream consumers misuse invalid oracle data if they don't check the valid flag? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Time Manipulation] Since the function depends on `clock: &Clock` for oracle price validation, can an attacker exploit clock manipulation to retrieve prices from different time windows within a single transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Data Consistency] The function iterates backwards through the ids vector (length-1 to 0) - can this reverse ordering cause price data to be returned in unexpected order, breaking assumptions in calling contracts about price/id alignment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle ID Validation] The function accepts `ids: vector<u8>` without validating whether the oracle_ids are valid/registered in the PriceOracle - can providing invalid oracle IDs cause the oracle::get_token_price to return default/zero values that appear valid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Decimal Precision Loss] The OracleInfo struct stores `decimals: u8` for each oracle - can mismatched decimal handling (e.g., 6 vs 9 vs 18 decimals) between oracles cause price calculation errors when consumed by vault value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Price Overflow] The `price: u256` field can store very large values - can extreme oracle prices (near u256::MAX) cause overflow when multiplied with asset amounts in downstream vault calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker provide an extremely large `ids` vector to cause excessive gas consumption in the while loop, potentially causing DoS for legitimate users or exceeding gas limits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Reentrancy Risk] Although this is a view function, does the call to `oracle::get_token_price()` potentially trigger external calls or callbacks that could reenter the lending protocol in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Trust Model] The function blindly trusts the PriceOracle object passed in - can a malicious actor provide a fake PriceOracle object that returns manipulated prices marked as valid=true? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Vector Capacity Attack] When repeatedly calling `vector::push_back(&mut info, OracleInfo {...})`, can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by requesting oracle info for thousands of IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Clock Reference Immutability] The function takes `clock: &Clock` as immutable reference - can multiple calls to get_oracle_info within the same transaction return different prices due to clock state changes, violating atomicity assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Aggregation Missing] The function queries individual oracle IDs but doesn't perform aggregation or median calculation - can a single compromised oracle feed manipulate vault calculations if the vault doesn't implement proper aggregation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Storage Mutation Risk] The function takes `storage_: &mut Storage` as mutable reference but should only read data - can this mutable access allow unexpected state mutations during supposedly read-only operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Integer Underflow] In the while loop with `length-1` used as asset_id, if reserves_count is 0, does accessing `storage::get_user_balance(storage_, length-1, user)` with u64 underflow cause incorrect reserve access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Index Bounds] When calling `storage::get_user_balance(storage_, length-1, user)` in the loop, can the length-1 index exceed valid reserve indices if reserves are added/removed concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [User Privacy Leak] The function allows querying ANY user's complete balance state - can this enable front-running attacks where attackers query large holder positions before executing manipulative trades? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Balance Consistency] The function queries user balances across multiple reserves but doesn't capture them atomically - can storage state changes between loop iterations cause inconsistent snapshots of user positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Asset ID Mismatch] The asset_id is set to `length-1` which is the reserve index - can this create confusion if reserve indices don't match asset IDs used elsewhere in the protocol? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Zero Reserves Case] If `storage::get_reserves_count(storage_)` returns 0, the while loop never executes - does this correctly handle the no-reserves edge case or can it cause issues in calling code expecting data? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Balance Overflow] The supply_balance and borrow_balance are stored as u256 - can extremely large balances cause overflow when aggregated or converted to smaller types in downstream calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Interest Accrual Timing] Does get_user_balance return raw balances or accrue interest first? If raw, can callers misuse stale balance data that doesn't reflect current interest, enabling arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Reverse Iteration Order] The function iterates reserves from highest to lowest index (length-1 to 0) - can this reverse ordering break assumptions in UI or integrations expecting reserves in creation order? (Low)"
