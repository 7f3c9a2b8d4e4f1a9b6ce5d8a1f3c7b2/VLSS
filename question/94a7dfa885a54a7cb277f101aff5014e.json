  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Receipt Vault Mismatch] At line 604, assert_vault_receipt_matched is called - can attacker craft receipt with matching vault_id but different RewardManager? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Receipt Status Race] At line 610, receipt status is checked to be NORMAL_STATUS - can status change between check and reward claim causing double claims? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Receipt Index Sync] At lines 657-658, receipt indices are updated to current manager indices - can stale receipt miss rewards if not updated frequently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: issue_receipt()] [Receipt Vault ID] At line 208, receipt is created with self.vault_id - can vault_id change after RewardManager creation causing mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Multiple Receipt Claims] Can single receipt claim rewards multiple times by calling claim_reward concurrently before reset_unclaimed_rewards at line 622 executes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Reward Token Loop] At lines 654-659, all reward tokens are iterated - can adding many reward types cause gas exhaustion DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: issue_vault_receipt_info()] [Clone Vec Map] At lines 221-224, reward_indices are cloned - can this create inconsistency if RewardManager indices update before VaultReceiptInfo creation completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Vault Receipt Retrieval] At line 609, vault_receipt_info is retrieved by receipt_id - can attacker manipulate receipt_id to access different vault receipts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Buffer Update Before Claim] At line 613, all buffers are updated before claim - can this cause unexpected reward distribution that affects claim amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Index Update Order] At line 658, vault_receipt.update_reward is called with new index - can incorrect update order cause reward calculation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Receipt Status Constant] At line 610, NORMAL_STATUS constant is 0 - can other status values bypass this check if not properly validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: issue_vault_receipt_info()] [Empty Unclaimed Rewards] At line 220, unclaimed_rewards table is created empty - can this cause issues if receipt expects pre-populated rewards? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Reward Type Mismatch] At line 617, reward type is derived from generic RewardCoinType - can type mismatch between claim call and actual reward balance cause failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Keys Reference] At line 654, reward_indices.keys() returns references - can modifications during iteration cause undefined behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Reset Unclaimed Rewards] At line 622, reset returns u256 and converts to u64 - can accumulated rewards exceed u64 max causing truncation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: issue_receipt()] [Version Check] At line 205, check_version is called before receipt creation - can version mismatch cause receipt to be incompatible with current manager? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Balance Split] At line 638, balance.split extracts reward - can this fail if concurrent claims drain balance first? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Vault Receipt Mut] At line 651, vault_receipt_info_mut is borrowed mutably - can concurrent borrows cause borrow checker failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Receipt ID Usage] Receipt ID is used at lines 607, 609, 615, 619, 633 - can ID collision across vaults cause cross-vault reward claims? (Critical)",
