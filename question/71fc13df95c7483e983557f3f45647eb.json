  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Minimum Check Bypass] At line 357, minimum is calculated as mul_with_oracle_price(total_shares, 1) - can an attacker add rewards when total_shares is manipulated to be low? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Actual Amount Calculation] At lines 515-519, actual_reward_amount is set based on minimum threshold - can this logic be exploited to prevent reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Bag Add Failure] At line 245, bag.add might fail if TypeName already exists - is this properly checked or can it cause state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: remove_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Table Remove] At line 326, table.remove is called - does this properly clean up all associated state or leave dangling references? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: reward_balance()] [Bag Borrow Safety] At line 717, bag.borrow is called without checking if TypeName exists - can this panic if reward type wasn't added? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: reward_amount()] [Table Access] At line 724, table.borrow is called directly - is there error handling if the reward type doesn't exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [VecMap Insert] At line 247, reward_indices.insert adds new entry - can duplicate inserts cause overwrite or does it fail safely? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_indices()] [VecMap Get/Mut] At lines 578 and 580, both get and get_mut are used - can this cause issues with borrow checker or state consistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_receipt_reward()] [Keys Iteration] At line 654, reward_indices.keys() returns vector for iteration - is this gas-efficient for many reward types? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Freeze Check Order] At line 349, assert_operator_not_freezed is called after vault_id check - should freeze check come first to prevent any state reading? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Freeze Bypass] At line 425, freeze check is done but rate update happens at line 437 - can operator status change between these lines? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Rate Zero Handling] At line 483, if rate is 0, only last_updated changes - can this be exploited to skip reward periods without distributing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Rate Calculation] At line 498, new_reward uses rate * time_delta - is there overflow protection for extremely large rates or time gaps? (High)",
