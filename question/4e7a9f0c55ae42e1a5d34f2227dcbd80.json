  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [ID Reuse] If Sui allows object ID reuse after deletion, can oracle_queue_id point to a deleted Queue's ID that gets reused for a different object type, causing type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Ownership Validation] Does run() validate that the Queue referenced by oracle_queue_id is owned/controlled by appropriate entities? Can it point to an adversary-controlled Queue? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Existence] Is there a check to verify the Queue object exists on-chain before setting oracle_queue_id? Can pointing to a not-yet-created future Queue ID cause failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Package Visibility] The actuate() function calls on_demand::set_oracle_queue_id which is package-scoped - is this the only way to change oracle_queue_id, or are there other entry points that bypass this action module's audit trail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Getter Usage] The actuate() function calls state.oracle_queue() to get old value - if this getter function has side effects or caches values, can it introduce unexpected behavior or staleness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Module Coupling] Does the tight coupling with on_demand::set_oracle_queue_id create upgrade risks? If on_demand module is upgraded with breaking changes, will this action module fail or misbehave? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Object Sharing] Since State is a shared object, can concurrent transactions from other modules modify State fields while run() is executing, causing inconsistent oracle_queue_id updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Module: set_oracle_queue_id_action] [Upgrade Path] If this action module is upgraded, can the new version introduce breaking changes that make historical OracleQueueIdSet events incompatible with new event schema? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Exhaustion] Can repeatedly calling run() with different oracle_queue_id values exhaust gas limits or cause transaction failures due to excessive State object mutations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Storage] If OracleQueueIdSet events are stored on-chain, can spamming run() fill up event storage and increase query costs for off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Lock DoS] Can a malicious admin call run() in a long-running transaction that holds State lock, blocking all vault operations that need to read oracle_queue during the update? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Cascade Failure] If changing oracle_queue_id causes all active vault operations to fail (due to oracle queue mismatch), can this be weaponized to DoS the entire vault system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Same Value Update] Can run() be called with oracle_queue_id equal to current State.oracle_queue? Does this no-op still emit events and consume gas unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Rapid Succession] If run() is called multiple times in rapid succession (different blocks but close together), can vault operations get confused about which oracle_queue_id to use? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Init State] Can run() be called on a State object that was just initialized with zero address for oracle_queue, and does this transition work correctly without special handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Rollback Scenario] If admin needs to rollback to a previous oracle_queue_id, can they call run() with the old value, or does the system expect monotonic increases/one-way changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Emergency Recovery] If oracle_queue_id was set to a malicious value, can admin quickly recover by calling run() again with correct value before any vault operations execute? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Operations Impact] When oracle_queue_id changes mid-epoch, can active volo-vault operations (deposits, withdrawals, rebalancing) that read oracle prices experience price inconsistencies between old and new queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Price Staleness] If the new oracle_queue_id points to a queue with stale prices, can volo-vault's assets_value_updated staleness check detect this, or will it accept outdated prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Health Factor Impact] If oracle_queue_id changes affect price feeds used by health-limiter for Navi health factor checks, can this cause false positives/negatives in health validation, allowing unsafe operations or blocking safe ones? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Loss Tolerance] Can changing oracle_queue_id to one with different price precision or feed quality cause vault loss_tolerance checks to fail incorrectly, blocking legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Compatibility] Do volo-vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus, Momentum) assume a stable oracle_queue_id? Can mid-operation changes cause adaptor state corruption or incorrect asset valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Share Price Impact] Can an admin manipulate vault share prices by timing oracle_queue_id changes to switch between queues with different price feeds for the same asset? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Request Buffer] Can oracle_queue_id changes affect pending deposit/withdrawal requests in vault request buffers, causing them to execute at wrong prices or fail validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Locking Window] If oracle_queue_id change occurs during a vault locking window for withdrawals, can this create an exploit where users bypass locks by timing withdrawals around oracle changes?
