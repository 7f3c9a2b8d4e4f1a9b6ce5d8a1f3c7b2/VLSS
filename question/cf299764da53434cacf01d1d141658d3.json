  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [Logic Error] The condition at line 15 checks ratio2_usage_start_time > 0 AND current_timestamp > max_duration + ratio2_usage_start_time.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [Overflow Protection] oracle_utils checks if ab_diff > sui::address::max() / 10000 to prevent overflow.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [Asymmetric Risk] calculate_amplitude divides by 'a' (first parameter = primary_price).
