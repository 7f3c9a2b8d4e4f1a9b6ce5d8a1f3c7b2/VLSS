  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: calculate_current_index()] [Zero Index] If current_supply_index or current_borrow_index from storage at line 268 is 0, ray_mul at lines 278/285 returns 0. Can this be exploited to reset indices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: calculate_current_index()] [Rate Manipulation] If an attacker can manipulate current_supply_rate or current_borrow_rate through storage, can they artificially inflate or deflate indices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: calculate_current_index()] [Compounded vs Linear] The function uses compounded interest for borrow (lines 274-278) but linear for supply (lines 281-285). Can this discrepancy be exploited for arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: calculate_current_index()] [No Timestamp Update] The function calculates indices but doesn't update last_update_timestamp.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_apy()] [Input Validation] The assert at line 299 prevents both estimate values from being non-zero, but can an attacker call with both zero to get incorrect APY calculations?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_apy()] [Rate Dependency] The function calculates borrow_rate first (lines 315-322) then uses it for supply_rate (lines 324-332).

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_apy()] [Utilization Manipulation] Since both rates depend on utilization calculated dynamically, can an attacker manipulate utilization to get favorable APY? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_apy()] [Storage Mutation] The function takes &mut Storage. Can it be called in a way that mutates storage affecting subsequent calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_apy()] [Return Value Manipulation] The function returns (borrow_rate, supply_rate). Can the caller misuse these values if they don't match actual protocol state? (Low)",
