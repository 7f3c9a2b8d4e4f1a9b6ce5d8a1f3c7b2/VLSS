  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Upgrade Path] During a module upgrade, if the new version of run() is incompatible with existing Queue objects, can this cause permanent DoS for fee type additions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Migration Risk] If queues need to migrate from version 1 to version 2, is there a safe migration path that doesn't allow attackers to exploit version mismatch during transition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Deprecation] If version 1 queues are deprecated but EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is not updated, will legitimate queues be unable to add fee types indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Atomicity] If validate() reads queue state and actuate() modifies it, can another transaction modify the queue between these two operations to violate validation assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Persistence] If queue.add_fee_type<T>() succeeds but the transaction fails before event::emit() completes, will the fee_types vector be in an inconsistent state with no event record? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Cross-Module Auth] If another module in the switchboard package can modify queue.authority or grant temporary authority capabilities, can this bypass the has_authority() check in validate()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Friend Module Exploit] Can friend modules of switchboard call actuate() directly without going through validate(), bypassing version and authority checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Checks] Does validate() check if the queue object itself is valid (not null, not corrupted), or only version and authority? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Null Reference] If queue parameter is somehow null or points to invalid memory, will run() panic gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Lifecycle] Does validate() check if the queue is in an active state (not destroyed, not frozen), or can run() modify destroyed queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Timing] If the event is emitted after add_fee_type(), can monitoring systems miss the state change if they process events out of order with on-chain state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Struct: QueueFeeTypeAdded] [Event Completeness] Does the QueueFeeTypeAdded event contain sufficient information for off-chain systems to validate the operation, or can malicious events with valid queue_id but wrong fee_type mislead systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Constraint] Does Move's type system enforce that T in run<T>() must be a valid coin type, or can arbitrary types be passed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Generic Bounds] If T is unconstrained, can an attacker pass a type that causes type_name::get<Coin<T>>() to produce unexpected results or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Unbounded Growth] Is there a maximum limit on the number of fee types that can be added to a queue, or can fee_types grow indefinitely causing storage DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker add fee types with extremely long TypeNames (e.g., deeply nested generics) to exhaust storage and cause transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Transition] If queue authority is transferred mid-transaction, can the new authority immediately call run() or is there a settlement period that validate() should enforce? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Revocation] If authority is revoked (set to a burn address), can validate() detect this and prevent run() from executing? (High)",
