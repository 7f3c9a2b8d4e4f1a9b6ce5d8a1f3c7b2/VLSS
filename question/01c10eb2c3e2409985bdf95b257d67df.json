  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [State Race] Between coin::split() on line 17 and public_transfer on line 24, can another transaction modify vault state causing inconsistency in expected coin holdings? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Partial State] If split_coin() succeeds but subsequent vault operations fail, does the remainder transfer remain committed, leaving vault in inconsistent state with coins transferred but shares not minted? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Conversion State] Does the balance conversion on line 33 maintain all state invariants from the original coin, or can metadata loss cause tracking issues in vault? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Adaptor Abuse] Can vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus) abuse split_coin_to_balance() to convert borrowed coins to balances without proper approval checks? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Object Ownership] After public_transfer on line 24, does ownership transfer of remainder break vault's expected coin custody model or receipt matching? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Object Reference] Can an attacker maintain a reference to the original split_coin object after it's destroyed (line 19) and use stale references to cause errors in vault tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Coin Uniqueness] If split creates multiple coin objects with overlapping amounts due to exploit, can this cause double-counting in vault balance calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Object Conversion] Does converting coin to balance on line 33 lose important object metadata (like coin ID) that vault needs for tracking deposits or receipts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Value Conservation] Is total value conserved between input coin and (split + remainder), or can the split operation leak/create value due to implementation bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Value Tracking] After split_coin() completes, does vault accounting properly track both the returned split amount and the transferred remainder to prevent value double-counting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Balance Value] Does the Balance returned on line 34 preserve exact value from the split coin, or can conversion cause value loss that breaks vault share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Remainder Value] If remainder value is very small (near zero but > 0), does transferring it on line 24 waste gas or create unusable dust in user accounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Price Timing] If vault uses oracle prices to calculate split amounts, can price changes between calculation and split_coin() execution cause incorrect value splits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Value Update] When split_coin_to_balance() is used to process deposits, does the timing of balance conversion affect vault's assets_value_updated tracking or cause stale value acceptance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Decimal Conversion] If amount parameter is calculated from oracle prices with different decimals (1e9 vs 1e18), can decimal mismatch cause massive over/under splits? (High)",
