  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Error Code] Since EIncorrectVersion error code is 1 (line 10), could error code collision with other modules cause confusion in debugging failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Error at table::add] If table::add aborts due to duplicate key (line 38), the error comes from sui::table module—could this make debugging difficult as users see an unexpected error message? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Init Failure] If init fails to create or share the Registry object (line 21-28), does the module become permanently unusable, or can init be retried? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Ctx Reuse] If TxContext is manipulated or reused across multiple create_lending_market calls in a single transaction, could this cause unexpected object ID generation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Capacity] If sui::table has a maximum capacity, could the lending_markets table become full, permanently preventing new market creation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Admin Cap] Since there's no RegistryAdminCap or owner capability, if the protocol needs to upgrade registry logic or migrate data, how can this be done securely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Version Upgrade Path] If registry.version needs to be incremented (line 35 check), but there's no upgrade function, could the registry become stuck on version 1 preventing protocol evolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Immutable Design] Since Registry fields are not mutable via any admin function, if the protocol needs to change registry logic, must a new registry be deployed abandoning all existing market registrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Single Initialization] Since init only runs once at module publication (line 21), if the initial registry setup is wrong, can it be corrected or must the module be republished? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Package Upgrade Impact] If the suilend package is upgraded, does the shared Registry object (line 28) automatically use new logic, or could this cause incompatibility between old registry data and new code? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [First-Mover Advantage] Since the first caller to create a market for type P gets the OwnerCap (line 39), could this create perverse incentives for rushing to claim valuable market types before others? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Market Squatting] Could an attacker preemptively create markets for all popular or upcoming asset types to hold them hostage or extract value from the protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Market Fee] Since there's no fee to create markets, what prevents someone from creating thousands of junk markets to pollute the registry namespace? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Owner Cap Valuation] Since LendingMarketOwnerCap grants admin control over a market, could these caps become valuable tradeable assets, and should their transfer be restricted? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: init()] [Shared Object Initialization] Since transfer::share_object is called at line 28, could there be a delay between module publication and registry availability where init hasn't executed yet? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Shared Object Contention] Since Registry is shared (line 28) and all create_lending_market calls mutate it, could this create transaction ordering contention reducing throughput? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Object Creation Limits] Does Sui have limits on object creation in a single transaction that could prevent create_lending_market from succeeding if it tries to create many nested objects? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [UID Exhaustion] Since object::new is called in init (line 23) and presumably in lending_market::create_lending_market (line 37), could UID exhaustion occur in an epoch with many market creations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Shared Object Storage Costs] Since Registry grows unboundedly (line 18), who pays for the increasing storage costs of the shared object as more markets are added? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Performance] As the lending_markets Table grows large (line 18), do table::add operations become O(n) or remain O(1), affecting create_lending_market performance? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [TypeName as Key] Since TypeName is used as the table key (line 38), what guarantees does type_name::get<P>() provide for uniqueness and collision resistance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [ID Storage Only] Since only IDs are stored (line 18) not references to LendingMarket objects, how can consumers of the registry actually access the markets, and could ID spoofing occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Duplicate Check] Before calling table::add (line 38), should there be an explicit check for key existence to provide better error messages than relying on table::add abort? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Vault Adaptor Interaction] If Volo Vault's Suilend adaptor uses this registry to lookup markets, could registry pollution or fake market registration redirect vault funds to malicious markets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Market Type Validation] Since Volo Vault may deposit funds into Suilend markets created via this registry, should there be validation that type P corresponds to legitimate asset types before registration? (High)"
