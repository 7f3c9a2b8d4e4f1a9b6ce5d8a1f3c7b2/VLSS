  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Public Function] The function is public and unrestricted - could malicious actors call it repeatedly with crafted inputs to discover which price values pass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Private Function] As a private function, parse_price_to_decimal() is only called internally - but could vulnerabilities in its arithmetic still be triggered through get_pyth_price_and_identifier()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Type Coercion] The casts to u8 at lines 62 and 67 could truncate values - does Move provide compile-time or runtime checks preventing this truncation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Reference Safety] The function takes references to PriceInfoObject and Clock - could these references be to dropped objects, causing undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Module: oracles] [Import Safety] The module imports from pyth::* and suilend::decimal - are these imports verified to be from trusted sources at compile time? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Decimal Overflow] The decimal::from(price_mag) conversion at lines 61 and 66 - does the Decimal type have maximum value limits that could be exceeded for large price_mag values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Decimal Precision] What is the internal precision of the Decimal type, and could loss of precision in div/mul operations accumulate when prices are converted multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Decimal Underflow] For very small prices (negative exponents), could the decimal division result in a value below the Decimal type's minimum representable value, rounding to zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Comment: Line 1] [Documentation] The comment mentions 'eventually switchboard prices' but no switchboard implementation exists - could this indicate incomplete migration or future changes that might break assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Comment: Line 11] [Specification] The comment describes MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO as 'confidence must be less than (100/x)% of price' - does the implementation at line 36 correctly enforce this, or is the logic inverted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Comment: Lines 15-18] [Return Documentation] The comment documents return type as '(spot price, ema price, price identifier)' but doesn't clarify spot is Option<Decimal> - could this cause caller confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Comment: Line 55] [Negative Price] The comment states 'suilend doesn't support negative prices' but doesn't explain what happens if negative prices are encountered - does it abort, return zero, or have undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Multiplication Overflow] In the confidence check `conf * MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO`, if conf is greater than u64::MAX/10, does Move abort on overflow or wrap around? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Subtraction Underflow] The staleness calculation `cur_time_s - price::get_timestamp(&price)` at line 45 - if protected by line 44's check, is there any edge case where the subtraction could still underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Power Overflow] The std::u64::pow(10, expo_magnitude as u8) operations - for what value of expo_magnitude does 10^expo_magnitude exceed u64::MAX? Is it checked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Status] Does Pyth's Price object have a status field (e.g., trading, halted, unknown) that should be checked before accepting the price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Number of Publishers] Should the function validate that the Pyth price has a minimum number of publishers contributing to ensure decentralization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Attestation] Does the function verify that the price has been attested on Sui, or could it accept prices from other chains? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Update Sequence] If Pyth prices are updated out of order (older price arrives after newer), could the staleness check pass for an outdated price? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Silent Failure] When returning option::none() for validation failures, no error code or reason is provided - could this make debugging difficult for integrators? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Panic Handling] If get_magnitude_if_positive or get_magnitude_if_negative abort on invalid inputs, are these aborts caught and handled gracefully by callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Partial Success] The function can return successfully with spot=None but valid EMA - could this partial success state cause callers to incorrectly proceed with operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Clock Validation] Does the function verify the Clock reference is to the singleton system Clock object, or could a custom Clock implementation be passed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Timestamp Consistency] If the Clock timestamp changes between line 42 and when the price is actually used (after function return), could this create timing vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Validation Bypass] Could an attacker pass a PriceInfoObject that has already been validated elsewhere, bypassing the need for current validation? (Medium)"
