  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Performance: Gas] [Function Call Overhead] Does calling these constant functions add gas overhead compared to inlining, and can this be exploited in gas-sensitive operations? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Precision: Basis Points] [Sub-Basis Point] Can the protocol represent fees smaller than 1 basis point (0.01%), or does percentage_benchmark()==10000 limit precision? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Option Type: Enum] [Type Safety] With no proper enum type and raw u8 values, can attackers pass arbitrary values like 255 or 0 to trigger undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Boundary: Max Reserves] [Exact Limit] What happens when exactly 255 reserves exist and someone tries to add the 256th? Does it fail gracefully or cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Boundary: Zero Values] [Zero Amount Operations] If operations with zero amounts use these constants in division, can this cause transaction aborts or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Boundary: Max Percentages] [Exceeding 100%] Can percentages exceed 10000 in calculations, and if so, what's the maximum safe percentage to prevent overflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Boundary: Time Wraparound] [Year 2106 Problem] Since Sui timestamps are u64 milliseconds, do calculations with seconds_per_year() correctly handle timestamp wraparound in year 2106? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/constants.move] [Edge Case: All Option Types] [Simultaneous Operations] Can an account trigger all four option types (supply, withdraw, borrow, repay) in one transaction to exploit state update ordering? (Medium)",
