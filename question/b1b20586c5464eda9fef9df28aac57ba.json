  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_min()] [Min Above Max] If min is set above max before verify_config() is called, but verify_config() checks min < max, could this cause all flash loans to fail until fixed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_max()] [Max to MAX_U64] Can an admin set max to u64::MAX, allowing flash loans larger than pool balance, causing withdraw failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_max()] [Max Below Active Loan] If max is reduced below an active outstanding loan amount, what happens when the user tries to repay? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: verify_config()] [Rate Sum Check] The check rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury < FlashLoanMultiple() uses strict <, but what if both rates are 0? Could this enable fee-free flash loans? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: verify_config()] [Overflow Risk] When adding rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury, if both are near u64::MAX / 2, could this overflow before comparison? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: verify_config()] [Min/Max Check] The check min < max uses strict <, so min == max is invalid, but what if both are 0? Could this lock all flash loan functionality? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: verify_config()] [Incomplete Validation] The function only checks rates and min/max, but doesn't validate pool_id exists or asset_id is unique - could invalid configs pass verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_asset_config_by_coin_type()] [Mutable Borrow] This function returns &mut AssetConfig, allowing callers to modify config directly - if called outside the intended setter functions, could this bypass verify_config() checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_asset_config_by_coin_type()] [Table Lookup] The function borrows from support_assets then assets - if there's a mismatch between these tables, could this return wrong config or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker call loan() from within a repay() callback (via pool interactions) to obtain nested loans with only one fee payment? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Receipt Swap] Can an attacker obtain multiple receipts via multiple loan() calls, then repay them in wrong order to exploit fee discrepancies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Cross-Pool Exploitation] Can an attacker take a loan from Pool A but repay to Pool B (same asset type) to exploit liquidity or rate differences? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset() + loan()] [Config Race] If create_asset() and loan() are called in quick succession, could loan() read incomplete config due to table inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_* + loan()] [Rate Manipulation] Can an admin front-run users' loan() transactions by updating rates to maximum, forcing users to pay excessive fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_* + repay()] [Fee Exploitation] If rates increase between loan() and repay(), users pay more than expected - but if rates decrease, do they pay less, creating arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Multiplication Overflow] In _loan_amount * cfg.rate_to_supplier, if _loan_amount = u64::MAX and rate_to_supplier > 1, this overflows before division by FlashLoanMultiple() - is there overflow protection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Multiplication Overflow] In _loan_amount * cfg.rate_to_treasury, same overflow risk exists - could this cause panic or silent overflow to small values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Division Precision Loss] Division by FlashLoanMultiple() truncates - if loan amount is small and rate is small, could fee round to 0, enabling fee-free flash loans? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Addition Overflow] In amount + fee_to_supplier + fee_to_treasury, if all three are large, could this overflow before comparison with repay_amount? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Cast to u256] Casting normal_amount as u256 should be safe, but if ray_math operations overflow u256 bounds, could this cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Counter Underflow] When count = count - 1, if count is 0 at loop entry, does Move prevent underflow or could this wrap to u64::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Table Corruption] If table::add() for assets succeeds but table::add() for support_assets fails, does the transaction rollback or leave orphaned entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker create unlimited assets to exhaust table storage, causing DoS for legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Table Borrow Lifetime] The function borrows from config.support_assets and config.assets - if these borrows overlap incorrectly, could this cause borrow checker violations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_asset_config_by_coin_type()] [Mutable Borrow Conflict] This returns &mut AssetConfig while config is borrowed - if called multiple times concurrently, could this violate Move's borrow rules? (Low)"
