  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: pool_not_found()] [Pool Existence] If pool_not_found() error (2100) is not validated before pool operations, can non-existent pool references cause aborts during critical operations like liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: price_feed_not_found()] [Oracle Missing] If price_feed_not_found() error (2101) is not handled gracefully, can missing price feeds cause all operations to fail, creating a denial-of-service condition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: rule_not_found()] [Rule Validation] If rule_not_found() error (2102) allows operations without configured rules, can risk parameters be bypassed, enabling unsafe leverage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_funds()] [Fund Validation] If invalid_funds() error (2103) does not validate fund objects (e.g., correct type, non-zero balance, ownership), can corrupted fund objects cause transfer failures or theft? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_option()] [Option Handling] If invalid_option() error (2104) is not checked when extracting Option values, can None values cause unwrap panics in critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Error Code Range: 1400-2104] [Error Code Collision] Are error codes guaranteed to be unique across all protocol modules? If codes collide, can error handling logic misinterpret errors, executing wrong recovery paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Error Code Range: 1400-2104] [Missing Error Codes] Are there missing error codes for critical failure scenarios (e.g., flash loan reentrancy, timestamp manipulation, type mismatch in generics)? Can absence of specific errors cause generic failures that obscure attack vectors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [All Functions] [Error Handling Gaps] If calling code catches errors but continues execution without proper state reversion, can partial state updates occur, violating atomicity and creating exploitable inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: paused() + user_is_unhealthy()] [Error Priority] If both paused() and user_is_unhealthy() errors could apply, which takes precedence? Can incorrect ordering allow unhealthy user operations during pause or block emergency liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: exceeded_maximum_deposit_cap() + exceeded_maximum_borrow_cap()] [Cap Interaction] If deposit and borrow caps are checked independently, can race conditions allow total TVL to exceed safe limits when deposits and borrows happen simultaneously? (Medium)"
