  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit a race condition between authority transfer (set_authority) and deletion, where validate() checks old authority but actuate() executes after authority change, allowing unauthorized deletion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: has_authority()] [Authorization Logic] Does has_authority() at line 19 properly validate ctx.sender() against aggregator.authority, or can an attacker spoof the sender address through transaction manipulation to bypass the authority check? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-sig Bypass] If the aggregator authority is supposed to require multi-sig approval, can a single authority holder call run() directly to delete the aggregator without other signers' consent, violating governance invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Between validate(&aggregator, ctx) at line 34 and actuate(aggregator) at line 35, can external state changes (queue updates, oracle updates) invalidate the validation, creating a TOCTOU vulnerability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Revocation] If aggregator authority is revoked or transferred between transaction submission and execution, does validate() at line 34 properly fail, or can a revoked authority still delete the aggregator? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Delegated Authority] If the Aggregator supports delegated authority patterns, does has_authority() at line 19 only check direct authority match, missing delegated authorities who should also be able to delete? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Emergency Pause Bypass] Is there any emergency pause mechanism in the Aggregator that should prevent deletion during critical operations, but run() bypasses by not checking pause status before deletion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit type confusion if aggregator.authority is not properly type-checked, passing an object that satisfies has_authority() but isn't the legitimate authority address? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Batch Deletion Attack] Can an attacker with authority over multiple aggregators call run() in a batch transaction to delete all critical oracle feeds simultaneously, causing mass DoS for dependent Volo Vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Inheritance] If Aggregator authority can be inherited through object ownership chains, does has_authority() at line 19 properly validate the entire ownership chain, or can intermediate owners be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-running Authority Transfer] Can a malicious old authority front-run their authority transfer transaction to delete the aggregator before the new legitimate authority takes control, griefing the new owner? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Zero Address Authority] If aggregator.authority is set to zero address (0x0) for some reason, does has_authority() at line 19 incorrectly pass validation if ctx.sender() is also spoofed as zero address? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Concurrent Authority Checks] If multiple transactions attempt to delete the same aggregator concurrently, can all pass validate() simultaneously before actuate() executes, leading to double-deletion attempts and undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Compromise Chain] If the authority address is compromised, can the attacker not only delete the aggregator but also create a new one with manipulated feed_hash to feed false prices to Volo Vault before anyone notices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Timelock Bypass] Should there be a timelock between deletion request and actual deletion for critical aggregators used by Volo Vault, but run() executes deletion immediately at line 34-35, bypassing governance safeguards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Signature Replay] If authority verification relies on signature checking (not visible in has_authority), can an attacker replay a valid authority signature from a previous legitimate deletion to delete other aggregators? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Chain Authority] If the system supports cross-chain aggregators, does has_authority() properly validate chain-specific authority, or can an authority from chain A delete aggregators on chain B? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker who temporarily gains authority (e.g., through a governance vote) delete aggregators before their authority expires, permanently removing critical price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [MEV Sandwich Attack] Can MEV bots sandwich the run() deletion between price update transactions to manipulate Volo Vault's asset valuation during the brief window when the aggregator is deleted but not replaced? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Role Confusion] If the system has multiple authority roles (admin, operator, manager), does has_authority() differentiate between them, or can lower-privilege operators delete aggregators meant only for admin deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy Guard Missing] Is there a reentrancy guard to prevent validate() or actuate() from being called recursively through external contract callbacks during aggregator.delete() at line 26? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Expiration] If aggregator authority should expire after a certain time for security, does has_authority() at line 19 check expiration timestamps, or can expired authorities still delete aggregators indefinitely? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Whitelist Bypass] If only whitelisted addresses should be able to delete certain critical aggregators, does validate() check against a whitelist, or can any address matching aggregator.authority delete regardless of whitelist status? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Ordering Attack] Can an attacker manipulate transaction ordering (priority gas) to ensure their malicious delete transaction executes before legitimate Volo Vault operations that depend on the aggregator?
