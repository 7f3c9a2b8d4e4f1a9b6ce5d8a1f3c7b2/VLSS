  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [One Market Per Type] The invariant is one market per type, but there's no mechanism to verify the market ID is correct. Could ID spoofing break this invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID-Object Consistency] The registry stores IDs but doesn't verify they point to valid LendingMarket objects. Could this invariant be violated through object deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Registry Ownership] The registry is shared but individual markets have owners. Could this ownership mismatch create governance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Object Deletion] If a LendingMarket is deleted, its ID remains in the registry. Could dangling IDs cause downstream issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [OwnerCap Transfer] The OwnerCap can be transferred after creation. Could this lead to loss of market control or governance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Object Freezing] Could the returned LendingMarket or OwnerCap objects be frozen by the caller, making them unusable? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Collision] The sui::table module uses TypeName as key. Could hash collisions in the underlying table implementation cause market ID conflicts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Table Add Failure] The table::add call can abort. Are there edge cases where this abort could leave the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Table Capacity] Does sui::table have a maximum capacity? Could reaching this limit cause permanent DoS for new market creation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Error Code Collision] EIncorrectVersion uses error code 1. Could this collide with error codes from other modules, causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Abort Handling] The function can abort on version mismatch or duplicate type. Could these aborts be exploited to DoS legitimate users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Error Recovery] There's no mechanism to recover from errors. Could failed market creations lock up resources permanently? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type Parameter Injection] Could an attacker craft a type parameter that, when serialized to TypeName, includes control characters or escape sequences? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Recursive Type] Could using recursive or self-referential types as P cause infinite loops or stack overflows in type_name::get()? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Type Size] Could extremely large or complex type parameters cause memory exhaustion when processed by type_name::get()? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Verification Missing] The function stores object::id(&lending_market) without verifying it matches the ID in the returned OwnerCap. Could mismatches cause authorization bypass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Freshness] There's no check that the ID is newly created. Could an attacker somehow reuse existing IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [ID Uniqueness] While object IDs are unique in Sui, could ID reuse across epochs or after object deletion cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Governance] The registry has no governance mechanism. Could this prevent necessary protocol upgrades or emergency interventions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Veto Power] There's no mechanism for protocol governance to veto or reverse market creation. Could malicious markets be registered permanently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Parameter Updates] Registry parameters (version, etc.) can't be updated after initialization. Could this make the registry obsolete? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Race Condition] Multiple transactions can attempt to create markets for the same type simultaneously. Could nondeterministic transaction ordering cause fairness issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Epoch Sensitivity] The function doesn't check the current epoch. Could epoch-dependent behavior in lending_market::create_lending_market cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Timestamp Manipulation] If lending_market creation is timestamp-sensitive, could validators manipulate timestamps to favor certain creators? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Vault Adaptor Trust] If Volo Vault's Suilend adaptor queries the registry for market IDs, could a malicious market be registered before the legitimate one, causing vault funds to interact with the wrong market? (Critical)"
