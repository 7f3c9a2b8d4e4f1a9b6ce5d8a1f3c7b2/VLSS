  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing()] [Test Function Exposure] The test function at line 186 is marked #[test_only] but accepts arbitrary price/timestamp inputs - if this attribute is bypassed or misconfigured, can anyone inject fake prices in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing()] [Abort Code Information Leak] The function aborts with codes 1-4 at lines 208, 236, 245, 255 - do these abort codes leak internal state information that could aid exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing()] [Validation Skip] The test version bypasses actual oracle adaptor calls - can test infrastructure accidentally be used in production, accepting unvalidated prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_prices_for_testing()] [Batch Atomicity] The batch update iterates over all feeds at lines 274-283 - if one feed update fails, does the entire batch revert, or can partial updates create inconsistent oracle state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_prices_for_testing()] [Vector Length Mismatch] If input vectors (prices, timestamps) have different lengths than vec_feeds, can out-of-bounds access occur, or will silent truncation cause some feeds to not update? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_prices_for_testing()] [Non-Abort Version] The function calls update_single_price_for_testing_non_abort which returns error codes instead of aborting - can error returns be ignored, allowing failed updates to appear successful? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing_non_abort()] [Error Code Confusion] Return codes 0-5 indicate different states - but if caller misinterprets these codes, can failed updates be treated as successes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing_non_abort()] [Severity Return Ambiguity] At line 337, severity is returned as (severity + 10) for non-warning levels - can this arithmetic cause code confusion if severity values are near u8::MAX? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price_for_testing_non_abort()] [Success Code Zero] Return value 0 at line 368 indicates success - but can this be confused with default/uninitialized return values in calling code? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Reentrancy via Events] Events are emitted at multiple points (lines 106, 123, 126, 129, 140) - can event listeners create reentrancy by calling back into update_single_price with manipulated parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Config Mutation During Update] The function reads from OracleConfig multiple times - if config is mutated by another transaction between reads, can inconsistent config values be used within a single update? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Price Oracle Shared State] The PriceOracle is passed as &mut and updated at line 164 - can concurrent updates to different feeds cause race conditions in the underlying oracle storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Clock Object Trust] The Clock object is passed by reference and accessed multiple times - if the Clock is a shared object, can clock manipulation between calls cause inconsistent timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Supra Oracle Manipulation] The OracleHolder from SupraOracle is an external dependency - can the Supra protocol upgrade or change its data format, breaking the adaptor without error detection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Pyth PriceInfoObject Staleness] Pyth PriceInfoObject is passed as reference - but does this contain timestamp validation, or can stale Pyth price objects be passed to update_single_price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: get_price_from_adaptor()] [Adaptor Version Skew] The adaptors (adaptor_supra, adaptor_pyth) are in separate modules - can version mismatches between oracle_pro and adaptors cause type confusion or ABI incompatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Strategy Module Trust] strategy::validate_price_difference and validate_price_range_and_history are external functions - can bugs in the strategy module cause oracle_pro to accept invalid prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Config Module Authority] config::get_price_feed_mut at line 59 returns mutable reference - can this be exploited to modify config state in unexpected ways if config module has vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [U256 Price Comparison] Prices are u256 but thresholds are u64 - in strategy::validate_price_difference, can u64 threshold comparisons with u256 prices cause overflow or incorrect validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timestamp Subtraction Underflow] Multiple timestamp subtractions occur (e.g., current_timestamp - primary_updated_time) - if timestamps are manipulated to cause underflow, can this bypass freshness checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Price Amplitude Calculation] strategy::calculate_amplitude is called on u256 prices - can extreme price ratios cause numerical instability or precision loss in amplitude calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Zero Price Handling] If final_price is 0 (from oracle failure), does the code properly reject it, or can zero prices be written to PriceOracle, breaking all dependent protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Decimal Scaling Edge Cases] When target_decimal is very small (e.g., 0) or very large (e.g., 18), can the decimal conversion in adaptors cause prices to round to zero or overflow to u256::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Oracle Sandwich Attack] Can an attacker observe pending update_single_price transactions, front-run with config changes to max_timestamp_diff or thresholds, manipulate price acceptance, then back-run to restore config? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Feed Address Collision] If feed_address at line 59 can collide or be substituted, can an attacker update wrong feeds or cause DoS by targeting non-existent feed addresses? (Medium)"
