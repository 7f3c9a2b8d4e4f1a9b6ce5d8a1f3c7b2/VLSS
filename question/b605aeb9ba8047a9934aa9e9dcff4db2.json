  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call oracle operations with mismatched version numbers if pre_check_version() is not invoked by all entry functions in oracle.move, config.move, and lending_core modules, allowing unauthorized state modifications after protocol upgrades? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Version Validation] If constants::version() returns 2 but an oracle object has version=1, can pre_check_version() abort with error::incorrect_version() during normal operations, causing DoS for legitimate users who haven't migrated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit a race condition where constants::version() is updated during a transaction but pre_check_version() reads the old cached value, allowing version mismatch to pass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Input Validation] Does pre_check_version() accept u64::MAX as input parameter v, and if so, can this cause an assertion failure when compared against constants::version()=2, enabling DoS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Missing Authorization] Since pre_check_version() is public, can any external module call it with arbitrary version numbers to probe the current protocol version without authorization? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Integer Overflow] Can next_version() overflow if constants::version() returns u64::MAX, causing the addition +1 to wrap around to 0 and breaking version migration logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Version Consistency] If next_version() is called multiple times during an upgrade transaction, does it guarantee the same value, or can constants::version() change mid-transaction causing inconsistent version states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Unused Function Risk] Since next_version() is public but appears unused in the codebase (only incentive_v2.move references it), can removing it break external integrations relying on this interface? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Constant Dependency] If oracle_constants.move is compromised and constants::version() is changed from 2 to 0, can all pre_check_version() calls fail, causing complete protocol DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Version Consistency] Can this_version() return different values in different transactions if constants::version() is not immutable, breaking version consistency assumptions across oracle operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Caching Issue] Does this_version() cache the result of constants::version(), or does it read fresh every time, potentially causing TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities in version checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Migration Path] During upgrade from version 1 to 2, if oracle.move's version_migrate() uses this_version() to set oracle.version, but pre_check_version() is called before migration completes, can legitimate operations abort with incorrect_version error? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Downgrade Attack] Can an admin downgrade protocol version by manipulating constants::version() to be lower than current oracle.version, bypassing migration safeguards and causing state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Version Skipping] If version jumps from 2 to 4 (skipping 3), does pre_check_version() enforce sequential upgrades, or can direct version=4 pass validation causing incomplete migration state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Backward Compatibility] If a v1 oracle object calls pre_check_version() after protocol upgrades to v2, does the assertion abort immediately, or is there a grace period allowing v1 operations to complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Integration Risk] In oracle.move's version_verification(), if pre_check_version() is bypassed by directly accessing oracle.version field, can operations proceed with mismatched versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Integration Risk] In config.move's version_migrate(), if this_version() is called before version bump completes, can cfg.version be set to an outdated value causing permanent version lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Lending Integration] In lending_core's flash_loan.move and storage.move, if pre_check_version() is missing from critical entry points, can version-incompatible oracle data be used for collateral calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Incentive Integration] In incentive_v2/v3.move, if version checks use this_version() but incentive objects have separate versioning, can version mismatch between oracle and incentive systems cause accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Missing Caps] Since no OracleAdminCap or capability object is required to call any function, can unauthorized parties query version info to plan timing attacks around upgrade windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Public Interface] All three functions are public, exposing version logic to all external modules - can malicious contracts wrap pre_check_version() to bypass version requirements in their own logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Friend Restriction] Should pre_check_version() be restricted to friend modules only to prevent external contracts from using it in unintended ways? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Error Code] If error::incorrect_version() returns error code 6200, can an attacker trigger this error repeatedly to spam events and consume gas, causing economic DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Assertion Failure] Can pre_check_version() assert failure cascade through caller functions in oracle.move, leaving shared objects in inconsistent states if transactions abort mid-execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [No Events] Since no events are emitted on version checks or queries, can silent version mismatches occur without detection, making incident response impossible? (Medium)"
