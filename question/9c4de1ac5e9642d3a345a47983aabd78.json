  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Supra Availability] If Supra oracle becomes unavailable or compromised, can the protocol gracefully degrade or does it fail completely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Pyth Security] Can Pyth's cryptographic price verification be bypassed by providing manipulated signatures or stale signed prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle Downtime] During oracle provider downtime, can vault operations continue with stale prices or are all operations halted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Oracle Censorship] Can oracle providers censor specific price updates to favor certain actors or attack the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Module Version] Can version mismatches between oracle modules (oracle, config, strategy, oracle_pro) cause incompatible function calls or data structure access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Constants Module] Can constants::success(), level_normal(), level_warning() return inconsistent values if the constants module is upgraded independently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Error Module] Can error codes from oracle_error module collide with success codes or be misinterpreted by calling contracts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Multi-Step Attack] Can an attacker combine pause state manipulation + oracle provider control + timing attacks to achieve price manipulation that each individual check would prevent? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Cross-Asset Attack] Can manipulating prices for one asset via this function affect vault calculations for other assets due to shared configuration or validation state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Gaming] Can attackers oscillate prices between threshold boundaries to trigger warning states that allow partial exploitation while staying under error thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Timer State] Does diff_threshold2_timer maintain per-feed state that could be corrupted by concurrent operations or exploited through state manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical State] Can historical_price and historical_updated_time become desynchronized, leading to inconsistent validation results? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Config State] Can rapid config updates cause race conditions where different validation steps use different config versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Price Zero] Can legitimate zero prices exist for some assets, and how does this interact with error returns that also use zero? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Price Maximum] Can prices approaching u256::MAX cause overflow in percentage calculations or multiplication operations downstream? (High)"
