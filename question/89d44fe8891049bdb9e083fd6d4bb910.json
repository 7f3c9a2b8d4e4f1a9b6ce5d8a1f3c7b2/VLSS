  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Index Stale State] Borrow uses borrow_index from update_state_of_all, but if another asset's state changes during execution, can cross-asset price correlation be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Health Factor Comparison Precision] Comparing health_factor >= health_factor_in_borrow using ray precision - can near-boundary values be exploited due to rounding to borrow when slightly unhealthy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Interest Rate Front-Running] Since interest rates update after borrow, can attacker observe pending high-value borrows and front-run with own borrow at lower rate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Borrow Index Manipulation] If attacker can influence borrow_index through prior actions, can they receive more favorable scaled_amount when borrowing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Validation Timing] validate_borrow called after update_state_of_all but before balance changes - can validation use stale state allowing invalid borrows? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Excess Amount Manipulation] If current_debt < amount, excess_amount returned - can attacker repay massive amount and manipulate excess_amount calculation to extract value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Loan Removal Race] Between checking repay_debt == current_debt and remove_user_loans, can interest accrue causing debt to increase and loan not be removed from list? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Interest Accrual Timing] update_state_of_all called before repay, so interest accrues - can attacker repay immediately after interest update to minimize repayment amount? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Borrow Index Changes] Between getting current_debt and decrease_borrow_balance, if borrow_index changes, can scaled_amount calculation be incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Zero Debt Exploit] Assert at line 166 prevents repay with zero loan, but can attacker create account with minimal loan to bypass limits elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Excess Calculation Overflow] When amount >> current_debt, can excess_amount = amount - current_debt overflow if amount is near u256::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Partial Repayment Rounding] For partial repays, ray_div for scaled_amount may round down - can attacker exploit rounding to repay less than intended over multiple transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Oracle Parameter Unused] _oracle parameter is unused in execute_repay - is this intentional? Could missing oracle check allow repayment with manipulated debt values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [Interest Rate Update Timing] Interest rates update after repay, but can attacker predict rate changes and time repayments to minimize costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_repay()] [State Event Emission] emit_state_updated_event uses current balance after decrease - can event data be manipulated if concurrent transaction occurs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Healthy User Liquidation Prevention] Assert at line 212 prevents liquidating healthy users, but is_health check uses current oracle - can attacker liquidate during oracle update window when user appears unhealthy? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Liquidation Amount Manipulation] calculate_liquidation returns multiple amounts - can attacker manipulate input amount to maximize executor_bonus_amount at expense of protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Treasury Amount Calculation] treasury_amount calculated in calculate_liquidation - can rounding errors cause treasury to receive less than intended, draining protocol reserves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Partial Liquidation Exploit] If is_max_loan_value is false, loan not fully removed - can attacker partially liquidate user repeatedly to extract maximum bonuses? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Collateral Asset Check] Assert at line 205 checks is_collateral, but between check and balance decrease, can collateral be removed causing inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Multi-Asset Interest Rate] update_interest_rate called for both collateral and debt assets - can attacker exploit cross-asset rate changes during liquidation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Executor Excess Amount] executor_excess_amount returned to liquidator - can attacker input excessive amount to maximize excess return as free arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Balance Decrease Atomicity] Line 226 decreases both collateral and debt - if partial failure occurs, can user be left in inconsistent liquidation state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Loan Removal Logic] remove_user_loans only if is_max_loan_value true - can attacker avoid loan removal by carefully sizing liquidation amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_liquidate()] [Oracle Price Timing] Oracle prices used in calculate_liquidation - can attacker liquidate immediately after unfavorable price update to maximize profit? (High)"
