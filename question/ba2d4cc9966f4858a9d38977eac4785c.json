  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [Trusted Registry Assumption] If Volo Vault assumes all markets in this registry are legitimate, could an attacker exploit this by registering malicious markets and tricking the vault into depositing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Health Factor Impact] If a malicious market is registered and Volo's health limiter checks are bypassed, could this expose vault funds to unprotected leverage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Oracle Integration] If Volo Vault relies on this registry to determine which Suilend markets are valid for oracle price integration, could fake market registration corrupt vault valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Creation Events] Since no events are emitted when a market is created (line 31-39), how can Volo Vault monitor for new Suilend markets to potentially integrate? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Market Status] Since the registry doesn't track market status (active, paused, deprecated) (line 15-19), could Volo Vault interact with defunct markets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Whitelist] Should there be a whitelist of allowed types P or creator addresses to prevent arbitrary market creation that could confuse integrating protocols like Volo? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Metadata] Without storing creator address, creation timestamp, or market parameters (line 18), how can auditors verify market legitimacy or trace ownership? (Low)"
