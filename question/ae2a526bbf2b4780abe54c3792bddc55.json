(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_apy()] [Vector Iteration DoS] At lines 121-176, nested while loops iterate through all pools—if an attacker creates thousands of active pools, can this cause transaction to exceed gas limits? (High)",
