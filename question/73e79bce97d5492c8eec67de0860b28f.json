  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Partial Failure] If actuate() partially succeeds but fails mid-execution, will validate()'s checks be re-run on retry, or can retry bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message] Error constants at lines 10-16 are generic. Can they leak sensitive information about queue internals to potential attackers analyzing failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] Can attacker with authority repeatedly call run() with different configs to consume gas, griefing legitimate updates or causing gas price spikes that DoS normal operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Gas Cost] Emitting QueueConfigsUpdated event at line 63 costs gas proportional to String name length. Can extremely long names cause gas exhaustion, preventing config updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Storage Cost] Does set_configs() at line 47 increase queue storage size? Can repeated updates with large names exhaust storage quotas, making queue unusable? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Batch Updates] If multiple config updates are needed, is there a batch function or must run() be called repeatedly? Can lack of batching make some config transitions impossible due to gas limits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Module: switchboard::queue_set_configs_action] [Dependency Trust] This module depends on switchboard::queue at line 5. If queue module is upgraded with different set_configs() semantics, will this action module break or behave unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Module Upgrade] If queue.set_configs() changes parameter order or types in module upgrade, will this actuate() call at line 47 fail to compile, or silently pass wrong values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Methods] validate() calls queue.version() and queue.has_authority(). If these methods are removed or behavior changes in queue upgrade, how does this module handle breakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Module] Uses sui::event at line 3.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Invariant: Fee Bounded] No check that fee at line 49 is within reasonable bounds.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Invariant: Config Coherence] No validation that new config combination (fee, min_attestations, validity) is economically viable. Can incoherent configs (high fee + high attestations + low validity) make oracle queue unusable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Invariant: Authority Exclusive] If multiple authorities exist, can they conflict by updating configs simultaneously? Is there authority coordination mechanism? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Economic: Fee Undercut] Can authority reduce fee at line 49 to attract users from competing oracle queues, but below sustainable oracle operator costs, causing long-term oracle abandonment?

(Critical)",
