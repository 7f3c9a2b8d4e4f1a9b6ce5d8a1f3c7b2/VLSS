  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Duplicate Override] If run() is called twice with identical parameters, could duplicate state cause issues in oracle internals? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Clock Epoch Boundary] If override happens exactly at epoch boundary, could clock.timestamp_ms() produce inconsistent value? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Self-Reference] Could queue and oracle parameters reference same underlying object through different wrapper types, breaking validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate() + actuate()] [Check-Effect Pattern] validate() only reads state while actuate() modifies. If validate() assumptions are violated before actuate(), could state corruption occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Atomicity] If validate() passes but actuate() reverts (oracle locked, insufficient gas), could partial execution leave system in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate() + run()] [Context Mutation] ctx is &mut TxContext in validate() and run().

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Completeness] validate() doesn't check secp256k1_key or mr_enclave. Is assumption that enable_oracle() will validate these, or is this a validation gap? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Type Confusion] Queue and Oracle are separate types. Could malicious module create fake Queue/Oracle objects satisfying validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reference Safety] Mutable references to queue and oracle. Could aliasing or reference invalidation cause memory safety issues? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [ID Type Safety] queue.id() and oracle.queue() return ID type. Could ID type confusion or casting enable validation bypass? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Enclave Attestation] mr_enclave is raw measurement. Is remote attestation verified elsewhere, or could attacker provide fake measurement? (Critical)",
