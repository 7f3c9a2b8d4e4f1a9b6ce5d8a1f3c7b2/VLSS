  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Capability Migration] If the protocol upgrades from volo_v1 to volo_v2, is there a secure path to migrate OwnerCap/OperatorCap without risk of duplication or loss during transition? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Fee Extraction] Can a malicious OwnerCap holder extract all protocol fees, staked assets, or user funds by calling privileged functions in other modules, with no withdrawal limits or delays? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Validator Manipulation] Could a compromised OperatorCap holder redirect all staked SUI to malicious validators controlled by the attacker, causing slashing or theft of user funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Pause Abuse] If OwnerCap holder pauses the protocol indefinitely, is there a community override mechanism or maximum pause duration to prevent DoS? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: test_init()] [Production Exposure] Is the test_init function with #[test_only] attribute guaranteed to be excluded from mainnet deployment, or could compilation flag errors cause it to be callable in production? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: test_init()] [Capability Minting] If test_init is accidentally exposed in production, can any caller invoke it to mint additional OwnerCap and OperatorCap, completely compromising protocol ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: test_init()] [Init Bypass] Could the existence of test_init enable bypass of single-initialization checks in the actual init function, allowing multiple capability sets to be created? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Transfer Mechanism] [Transfer Hook] Does Sui's transfer::transfer function have any hooks or callbacks that could be exploited during OwnerCap/OperatorCap transfer to intercept or duplicate capabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Transfer Mechanism] [Transfer Atomicity] If transfer::transfer fails partway through (out of gas, object storage errors), is the capability stuck in limbo, or does it remain with the original owner? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Transfer Mechanism] [Transfer Finality] After transfer::transfer completes, can the original owner retain any references or callbacks that allow them to continue using the transferred capability? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Transfer Mechanism] [Object Destruction] Can transfer::transfer be called with 'to' address set to a special value that destroys the capability instead of transferring it, causing permanent loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Transfer Mechanism] [Transfer Denial] Could the 'to' address reject capability receipt (via object limit or policy), causing transfer::transfer to revert and trap the capability with the current owner? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Multi-Sig] The module only supports single-key ownership - does the protocol have an external multi-sig wrapper, or is all admin control centralized to one private key? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Timelock] There is no built-in timelock for capability transfers - can a compromised key immediately transfer ownership without any delay for community response? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Transfer Confirmation] Capability transfers are one-way with no recipient confirmation - can this cause accidental loss if the recipient address is incorrect? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Revocation Registry] There is no registry of revoked or blacklisted capabilities - if a capability is compromised, can it be globally invalidated without protocol upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Capability Expiry] Capabilities never expire - could long-lived capabilities increase risk of key compromise over time with no automatic rotation? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Delegation] There is no mechanism for OwnerCap holder to delegate specific permissions to OperatorCap - is the privilege separation too coarse-grained? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Emergency Admin] There is no separate emergency admin capability for time-critical responses (pause, freeze) - must all emergency actions wait for OwnerCap holder? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Capability Recovery] If both OwnerCap and OperatorCap are lost, is there any recovery mechanism (social recovery, governance) or is the protocol permanently locked? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Rate Limiting] Capability transfers have no rate limits - could rapid transfers be used to evade detection or compliance monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Missing Feature] [No Transfer History] The module doesn't maintain on-chain transfer history - are off-chain event indexers the only source of ownership history, creating centralization risk? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Object Lifecycle] [UID Uniqueness] Is object::new(ctx) cryptographically guaranteed to generate unique UIDs, or could UID collisions in edge cases allow capability confusion across protocol instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Object Lifecycle] [Object Deletion] Since capabilities have 'key' but not 'drop', can they be accidentally deleted via object system operations, causing permanent privilege loss? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Object Lifecycle] [Storage Costs] Does holding OwnerCap/OperatorCap impose ongoing storage costs on the owner, and could unpaid storage cause capability deletion or lock? (Low)"
