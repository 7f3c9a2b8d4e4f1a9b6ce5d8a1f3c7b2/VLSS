  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: max()] [Edge Case] When max(a, a) is called with identical Decimals, does it consistently return same value, or can implementation return different copies causing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: min()] [Clamping Logic] If min() is used to cap fees, can attackers bypass cap by exploiting precision where actual_fee is slightly below min but rounds up after multiplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: max()] [Zero Floor] When max(calculated_fee, 0) is used to prevent negative fees, does this mask underflow bugs where fees should never be negative? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: add()/sub() sequence] [Invariant Violation] If vault uses add() to accumulate deposits and sub() to process withdrawals, can overflow in add() or underflow in sub() break total_balance invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: pow()/mul() combination] [Compound Errors] When using pow() for compound interest then mul() to apply to principal, do precision losses compound to create significant gap between actual and expected returns? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: from_percent()/mul() usage] [Misconfiguration] If vault code uses from_percent(x) expecting basis points but x is in bps units, does this cause 100x error in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Constant: WAD] [Hardcoded Value] Is WAD = 1e18 the optimal precision for all use cases, or can this cause overflow in certain operations that would work with lower precision? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Constant: WAD] [Cross-Protocol] If external protocols use different precision (e.g., 1e9 for Sui balances), can conversion errors between WAD-based and native precision cause loss of funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Constant: WAD] [Range Limit] Does WAD = 1e18 limit maximum representable integer to ~1e59 in u256 (2^256/1e18), and can this limit be exceeded in total value calculations? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Constant: U64_MAX] [Type Mismatch] Since U64_MAX is typed as u256, can incorrect comparisons or casts cause off-by-one errors when checking u64 boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Copy Trait] Does Decimal having 'copy' trait allow unintended duplication in vault accounting where values should be moved to prevent double-counting? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Store Trait] Does 'store' trait allow Decimals to be stored in global storage, and can this enable persistence of stale/incorrect values across transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [No Key Trait] Does lack of 'key' trait prevent Decimal from being top-level object, and is this intentional to prevent direct manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Single Field] Does having only 'value: u256' field make Decimal vulnerable to raw value manipulation via from_scaled_val() bypass? (Medium)",
