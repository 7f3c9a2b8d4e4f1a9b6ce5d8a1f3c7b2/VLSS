  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Staleness Calculation] Uses diff() which returns absolute difference - does this correctly handle both past and future timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Conditional Staleness] Only checks staleness if now >= max_timestamp - what's the intent for future timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [No Staleness Update] Updates price and timestamp, but what if the new price is also stale? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Initial Staleness] Sets last_updated to now, but doesn't verify init_price is actually current? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Package-Level Access] Any package module can call - should this require admin capability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [No Role Check] Package access without role verification - can rogue modules abuse this? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Operator Authority] Critical function has package access - should adding price feeds require stricter auth? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Removal Authority] No confirmation or timelock before removal - can accidental removals harm vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Change Authority] Instant aggregator change without validation - should this require multi-sig or timelock? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Upgrade Authority] Version upgrade has no role check - can any package module upgrade at will? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Public Update] Being public allows anyone to update prices - could this be rate-limited or restricted? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Error: ERR_AGGREGATOR_NOT_FOUND] [Error Recovery] When aggregator not found, function panics - can this DoS vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Error: ERR_PRICE_NOT_UPDATED] [Staleness Handling] Panics on stale price - should there be fallback logic or grace period? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Error: ERR_AGGREGATOR_ALREADY_EXISTS] [Duplicate Handling] Prevents duplicates but doesn't suggest alternatives - can this cause integration issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Error: ERR_AGGREGATOR_ASSET_MISMATCH] [Mismatch Consequences] Panics on mismatch, potentially DoS'ing price updates - should this be more graceful? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Error: ERR_INVALID_VERSION] [Version Error Impact] Version mismatch causes all operations to fail - is there a recovery path? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_current_price()] [Test Function Exposure] test_only function can bypass all validation - are there guards preventing production use? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_aggregator()] [Test Backdoor] Can add aggregator with price 0 and arbitrary address - could this be exploited if test_only is bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: init_for_testing()] [Test Init] Creates separate config for testing - can multiple configs coexist and cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Annotation: #[test_only]] [Compilation Safety] Relies on compilation flags to hide test functions - are there bypass techniques? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Price-Timestamp Coupling] Updates price and timestamp separately - can they become desynchronized? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Multi-Field Update] Updates aggregator, price, and timestamp non-atomically - can partial updates occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceInfo] [Field Consistency] Four fields must stay consistent - are all update paths atomic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Initialization Consistency] Multiple fields set during add - can initialization fail partway through? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Update Incentives] Public function with no rewards - will prices be updated frequently enough in practice? (Medium)"
