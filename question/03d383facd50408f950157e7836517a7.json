  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Volo Vault Dependency] [Hard Dependency] If Volo vault adaptors have hard dependencies on MMT v3 version checks, would the abort behavior cause all Momentum and Cetus position management to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Version Calls] [Version Mismatch] If different Volo vault components use different Version object instances, could inconsistent version states allow operations with incompatible MMT v3 versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Gating] [Feature Bypass] If new MMT v3 features are version-gated but version checks abort, could users access unfinished or unsafe features in Volo vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Deprecation Policy] [Forced Upgrade] If major version upgrades break backward compatibility, could users with locked positions in Volo vaults be unable to withdraw if they don't upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Migration] [State Migration] If Version is upgraded but no migration path exists for existing Volo vault states, could funds become permanently locked in incompatible versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: assert_supported_version()] [DoS on Check] If assert_supported_version() is called in critical paths (deposits, withdrawals, rebalancing) and always aborts, would it create complete DoS for all Volo vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Upgrade DoS] [Griefing Attack] Could a malicious VersionCap holder repeatedly upgrade versions to trigger failed compatibility checks, causing DoS for Volo Protocol users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Shared Version Object] [Lock Contention] If Version is a shared object accessed by every transaction, could high contention cause performance degradation or DoS for Volo vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: VersionCap] [Centralization Risk] If VersionCap is held by a single admin address, does this create a single point of failure where compromise of that address allows arbitrary version manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_major()] [Governance Bypass] If upgrade_major() has no timelock or multi-sig requirement, could a compromised admin instantly upgrade to a malicious version affecting all Volo users? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: set_version()] [Emergency Override] Could set_version() be abused by admins to skip version verification processes and deploy untested MMT v3 code directly to production Volo vaults? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [VersionCap Distribution] [Key Management] If VersionCap private keys are compromised, could an attacker control all future MMT v3 versions used by Volo Protocol, enabling long-term exploitation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Test Function: destroy_version_for_testing()] [Test Leak] Is destroy_version_for_testing() properly gated with #[test_only] to prevent accidental calling in production that would destroy Version state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Commented Code] [Incomplete Implementation] The commented init_() test function suggests incomplete implementation - could the production init() also be incomplete, causing deployment failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: init()] [Transfer Logic] The commented code shows VersionCap would be transferred to tx_context::sender(ctx) - could this send upgrade authority to the wrong address in production? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Semantics] [Semver Compliance] Does the version system follow semantic versioning where major increments indicate breaking changes? If not, could incompatible changes be deployed as minor updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Comparison] [Comparison Logic] If version comparison uses simple >= checks without proper major.minor.patch semantics, could version 2.1 incorrectly be considered greater than 10.0? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Range] [Compatibility Range] Without support for version ranges (e.g., >=1.2.0, <2.0.0), could Volo Protocol be forced to support only exact version matches, preventing security updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: assert_supported_version()] [Error Messages] If implemented without descriptive error messages, would failed version checks in Volo Protocol provide no indication of which version was expected vs actual? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [All Functions] [Abort Codes] All functions use 'abort 0' - if this remains in production, would error codes 0 from multiple sources be indistinguishable, hindering debugging of Volo vault failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_major()] [Upgrade Failure] If upgrade_major() can fail (e.g., during version validation), are there proper error codes to distinguish different failure modes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: Version] [Direct Field Access] Without getter functions enforced, could external modules directly access Version.major_version and Version.minor_version fields, bypassing version validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: value_major()] [Getter Availability] If value_major() aborts, how do legitimate consumers read the major version for compatibility checks in Volo Protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: value_minor()] [Getter Availability] If value_minor() aborts, how do legitimate consumers read the minor version for feature detection in Volo vault adaptors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: Version] [Object Sharing] If Version should be a shared object but init() doesn't share it, would each transaction create its own Version instance causing inconsistent version state? (Critical)"
