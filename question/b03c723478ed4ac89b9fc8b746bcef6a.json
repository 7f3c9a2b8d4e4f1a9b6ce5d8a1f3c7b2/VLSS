  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_attestation_msg()] [Attestation Message Size] With fixed 32-byte fields and one 64-byte field, is the total 192+ byte message size enforced, or can shorter messages pass validation?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Slothash Validation] Is slothash validated to represent a legitimate Solana slot hash, or can arbitrary 32-byte values be used to forge cross-chain oracle updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Slothash Replay] Can old slothash values be replayed in new update messages to make stale data appear fresh, bypassing temporal validity checks? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Struct: Hasher] [Copy Ability Exploit] Since Hasher has 'copy' ability, can an attacker clone a partially-filled Hasher to create multiple messages with shared prefixes but different suffixes, enabling batch forgery? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Struct: Hasher] [Drop Ability] With 'drop' ability, are there scenarios where dropping a Hasher with sensitive data in its buffer leaks information or leaves memory unsanitized? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Struct: Hasher] [Buffer Visibility] Is the buffer field private enough? Can other modules access or modify the buffer directly, bypassing hash integrity? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Vault Price Feed Integration] When vault reads oracle prices, can hash verification pass while the Decimal value differs from what's stored, enabling price feed manipulation in vault asset valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Max Variance Vault Tolerance] If vault has its own loss_tolerance and oracle has max_variance, can these conflict such that hashes validate while vault constraints are violated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: generate_update_msg()] [Min Responses vs Vault Oracle Count] If vault expects N oracles but min_responses in hash is < N, can partial consensus validate while vault assumes full consensus? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: finalize()] [Hash Output Length] Does SHA2-256 always produce exactly 32 bytes? Can implementations vary, causing hash length mismatches in signature verification? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: finalize()] [Hash Collision Resistance] Is SHA2-256 collision-resistant enough for financial oracles with billions in TVL? Could quantum computers break hash collision resistance? (Low)",
