  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [State Consistency] Does next_version() guarantee same return value for all callers within same block/epoch, or can different callers see different next versions causing migration inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Object Versioning] Can object-level version field (storage.version) diverge from module-level constants::version() during partial upgrade, and does pre_check_version() handle this gracefully? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Gas DoS] Can attacker spam pre_check_version() calls with mismatched versions to consume gas and increase transaction costs for legitimate users trying to execute version-checked operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Performance DoS] If this_version() calls are not cached and every operation calls it multiple times, can high-frequency operations cause gas exhaustion through repeated constants::version() reads? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Computation Cost] Does next_version() computation cost increase with version number, and can high version values cause gas-based DoS for migration operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Governance Bypass] Can admin upgrade constants::version() without proper governance vote, and does this_version() enforce any governance checks before returning new version? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Emergency Response] During security incident requiring emergency version rollback, does pre_check_version() support downgrades, or does it only allow forward version progression? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Version Policy] Does next_version() enforce version increment policy (e.g., must increment by 1, not skip versions), or can admin arbitrarily jump from version 13 to version 100? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version() + pre_check_version()] [Atomic Consistency] Can this_version() return version 13 when called from pre_check_version() but version 14 when called from version_migrate() in same transaction block, breaking migration atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version() + pre_check_version()] [Version Sequence] If version_migrate() uses next_version() to set new version but pre_check_version() checks against this_version(), can off-by-one errors occur where object is at version 14 but protocol expects 13? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version() + next_version()] [Increment Logic] Does next_version() always return this_version() + 1, and can this assumption be violated if constants::version() changes between the two function calls within same transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: All Functions] [Module Upgrade] If version.move module itself is upgraded with different function signatures, can existing code calling these functions break, and is there version compatibility checking for the version module itself? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [MEV Attack] Can MEV bots detect pending version_migrate() transactions and sandwich them with operations that exploit version transition window to extract value from version-dependent pricing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Oracle Manipulation] If oracle prices change between versions and this_version() is used to determine which oracle to query, can attacker manipulate version timing to use favorable oracle version for liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can attacker use flash loan to temporarily lock all protocol objects, preventing version_migrate() execution, then execute version-checked operations that expect old version state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Cross-Chain Attack] If protocol deploys to multiple chains with different version states, can attacker exploit version discrepancies to arbitrage between chains or replay transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Navi Adaptor] When volo-vault's Navi adaptor borrows assets from lending_core, does it call pre_check_version() to ensure lending_core version is compatible with vault's expected version, preventing borrow/return mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Suilend Integration] Can Suilend obligations created through volo-vault adaptors become invalid if lending_core version changes, and does this_version() provide compatibility signals to external protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Cetus CLMM] When vault operates Cetus positions using borrowed lending_core assets, can version mismatch cause position liquidation if pre_check_version() prevents asset return during critical price movements? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Switchboard Oracle] Does Switchboard oracle version need to match lending_core version for price feeds, and does this_version() enforce this compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Reserve Creation] When init_reserve() is called after version_verification() which uses pre_check_version(), can version change between check and reserve creation cause reserve to be initialized with wrong version schema? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Pool Isolation] Can isolated pools have different versions than main pool, and does this_version() return pool-specific or global protocol version? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Multi-Reserve] When operating on multiple reserves in single transaction, does pre_check_version() ensure all reserves are at same version, or can mixed-version reserves cause accounting errors?
