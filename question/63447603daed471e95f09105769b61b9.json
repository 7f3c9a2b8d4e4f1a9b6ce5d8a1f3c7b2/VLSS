  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Protocol Integration] If Suilend's rate limiter is used to protect deposits/withdrawals, can attackers exploit differences between Suilend and Volo Vault rate limiting strategies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Protocol Integration] Can rate limiter state become inconsistent with Suilend's obligation system if obligations are updated outside the rate limiter's control? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Protocol Integration] Does the rate limiter properly account for Suilend's interest accrual when calculating outflow quantities, or can interest be used to bypass limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Protocol Integration] If Volo Vault adaptors interact with Suilend obligations, can they circumvent rate limits by borrowing assets instead of withdrawing? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Function: new()] [State Recovery] After initialization with new(), can the rate limiter state be recovered if the system needs to resume from a previous checkpoint? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/rate_limiter.move] [Struct: RateLimiter] [State Migration] If rate limiter logic needs to be upgraded, can existing rate limiter states be migrated without losing accumulated outflow history? (Medium)",
