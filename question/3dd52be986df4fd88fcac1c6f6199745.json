  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Integration: Validator Weights] [Weight Deltas] If validator weight adjustments use I64 and wrap on overflow, could attacker manipulate weights to monopolize delegations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Integration: Health Factor] [Negative Health] If Navi health factor delta uses I64 and becomes negative due to underflow, could unsafe positions pass health checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Integration: Asset Value] [Value Deltas] If total_usd_value change tracking uses I64 and overflows, could vault appear to have lost value when it gained, triggering false emergency mode? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Constant: MIN_AS_U64] [Boundary Value] MIN_AS_U64 = 1 << 63 = 0x8000000000000000 represents most negative I64 - could off-by-one in boundary checks allow MIN_AS_U64-1 to be accepted as valid I64? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Constant: MAX_AS_U64] [Boundary Value] MAX_AS_U64 = 0x7fffffffffffffff is maximum positive I64 - could accepting MAX_AS_U64+1 create I64 equal to MIN_AS_U64 corrupting sign? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Constant: EOverflow] [Error Code] EOverflow = 0 used for overflow errors - could error code 0 conflict with generic abort codes making overflow errors indistinguishable from other failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Constants: LT/EQ/GT] [Comparison Results] LT=0, EQ=1, GT=2 as comparison result encoding - could caller confuse these with boolean 0=false, 1=true breaking comparison logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Type Safety] I64 has copy, drop, store abilities - could copy ability allow I64 values to be duplicated without proper accounting in vault share tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Bit Representation] I64.bits stored as u64 in two's complement - could direct bit manipulation bypass I64 invariants if bits field is accessible via reflection or unsafe code? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Struct: I64] [Store Ability] I64 has store ability allowing storage in other structs - could storing I64 in Bag or Table allow type confusion if retrieved without proper type checking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: mul()] [Missing Zero Test] No test for mul(from(0), X) - could zero multiplication produce non-zero due to uninitialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: div()] [Missing Zero Divisor] No test for div(X, from(0)) - could division by zero panic instead of returning error code? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: shl()/shr()] [Missing Large Shift] No test for shift amounts > 63 - could shifts >= 64 cause undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: mod()] [Missing Zero Divisor] No test for mod(X, from(0)) - could modulo zero abort ungracefully? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: abs_u64()] [Missing Zero] No test for abs_u64(from(0)) - could zero conversion return non-zero value? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: sign()] [Missing Zero] No test for sign(from(0)) - could zero have ambiguous sign? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: Comparison] [Missing Edge Cases] No tests for comparing MIN_AS_U64 with itself or MAX_AS_U64 with itself - could self-comparison fail equality? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: wrapping_sub()] [Missing MIN/MAX] No test wrapping from MIN_AS_U64 all the way to MAX_AS_U64 - could full range wrap have edge cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Test Coverage: Bitwise] [No Tests] No tests for or() and and() functions - could bitwise operations be completely unvalidated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Implementation: All Functions] [Unimplemented] Every public function is stub returning 'abort 0' - could production deployment with unimplemented I64 cause all arithmetic operations to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Implementation: Private Helpers] [Unimplemented] Helper functions u64_neg() and u8_neg() are also stubs - could these be forgotten during implementation causing cascading failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Implementation: Tests] [Test-Only Code] Tests exist but implementation doesn't - could tests pass against stub implementation but fail when real code is added? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Wrapping Addition] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] Attacker deposits to vault causing total_usd_value calculation overflow via wrapping_add(), making massive loss appear as gain, bypassing loss_tolerance checks and allowing further deposits into failing vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Division Overflow] [Share Price Manipulation] Attacker forces div(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64), neg_from(1)) in share price calculation causing abort, DoSing deposits/withdrawals until epoch rollover? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Exploit: Comparison Error] [Validator Manipulation] If validator weight comparisons use I64 and sign handling is incorrect, could attacker manipulate weights by triggering negative overflow making smallest weight appear largest?
