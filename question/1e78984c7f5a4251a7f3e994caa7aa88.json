  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Key Normalization] If oracle_key comparison in existing_oracles_contains() doesn't normalize (e.g., case-folding, Unicode normalization), could an attacker create 'duplicate' oracles with keys that differ only in normalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Info Leak] The error constants EOracleKeyExists and EInvalidQueueVersion expose internal state - could an attacker use these to probe for valid oracle_keys or queue versions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Abort Handling] If validate() aborts with EOracleKeyExists or EInvalidQueueVersion, the transaction reverts - but are there any state changes before validation that aren't rolled back? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Partial Failure Recovery] If queue.add_existing_oracle() fails after oracle::new() succeeds, does the entire transaction abort and roll back the oracle creation, or could orphaned oracles remain? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Context Mutation Safety] The ctx: &mut TxContext parameter is passed to oracle::new() - could malicious context manipulation affect oracle creation or allow privilege escalation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spoofing] The OracleCreated event is emitted at line 47 - can an attacker create fake events by calling functions that emit similar structures, confusing off-chain oracle monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] If multiple run() calls execute in the same block, could event ordering issues cause off-chain systems to process oracle creations in wrong order or miss some events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Integrity] The OracleCreated event copies oracle_key by value - if the oracle_key is extremely large, could this cause gas issues or event processing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Hardcoding] EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1 - if the Queue module upgrades to version 2, all oracle creation will fail until oracle_init_action is updated, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade Attack] If Queue.version() can be downgraded from 2 to 1 by an admin, could this allow oracle creation on deprecated queue versions with known vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Type Confusion] The version is u8 (0-255) - could version wraparound or overflow cause version checks to pass incorrectly if Queue version exceeds 255? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Module Upgrade Risk] If the oracle module is upgraded and oracle::new() signature or behavior changes, could this break oracle_init_action without compile-time detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Module Trust] The code trusts Queue methods (version(), existing_oracles_contains(), add_existing_oracle()) - if Queue module has bugs, can this module be exploited indirectly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Module Dependency] The code uses sui::event::emit() - if event emission can fail or be manipulated, could this affect oracle creation integrity or off-chain monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vector Copy Semantics] The oracle_key is passed by value to run(), then by reference to validate(), then by value to actuate() - could this cause unexpected copies or moves that corrupt the key? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [ID Type Safety] The oracle_id is of type ID - could there be type confusion between oracle IDs, queue IDs, or other object IDs that breaks invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Reference Lifetime] The validate() takes &vector<u8> and &Queue references - could reference lifetime issues cause use-after-free or dangling references? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Storage Exhaustion] Calling queue.add_existing_oracle() repeatedly could fill queue storage - is there a limit on how many oracles can be added, or could this DoS the queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Cost Manipulation] If an attacker finds oracle_keys that maximize gas costs in existing_oracles_contains() or add_existing_oracle() (e.g., worst-case map operations), could this make oracle creation prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Storage Costs] Emitting OracleCreated events with large oracle_keys could consume significant storage - could this be weaponized to exhaust storage limits or increase costs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parallel Transaction Attack] If multiple transactions call run() with different oracle_keys on the same Queue concurrently, could race conditions in Queue's internal state cause corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: validate() + actuate()] [Check-Then-Act Race] The validate() reads queue state, then actuate() modifies it - in Sui's consensus model, could parallel transactions interleave these operations causing TOCTOU issues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Creation Ordering] If oracle::new() creates oracles with sequential IDs or timestamps, could transaction ordering manipulation allow an attacker to predict or manipulate oracle IDs?

(Critical)",
