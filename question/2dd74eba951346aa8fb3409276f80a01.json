  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Recursive Call Risk] Does calculate_user_reward call any functions that could recursively call it back, creating infinite loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Asset Type String] Asset types are returned as String (line 49) - can these strings be manipulated or contain special characters that break claim logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Reward Type String] Reward types are String from line 50 - can different coin types have identical string representations causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Generic Type Parameter] The function uses RewardCoinType generic - can this be instantiated with non-coin types to bypass checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Snapshot Consistency] The function takes snapshots of pools, rules, balances at different times - can state changes between snapshots cause inconsistent reward calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rule State Snapshot] Rule state is read at line 74 - can rule be modified after this point but before calculation completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Multi-Read Consistency] The function reads from rule multiple times (lines 94, 102, 103) - are these reads guaranteed to be consistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Nested Loop Complexity] The nested while loops (lines 23-56, 32-55) have O(n*m) complexity - can this cause gas exhaustion for users with many pool/rule combinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Loop Variable Mutation] pool_keys and rules_keys are mutated during iteration - can this cause elements to be skipped or processed twice? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Break Condition] The while loops check vector length each iteration - can vector length change during iteration causing early exit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Supply/Borrow Switch] The function switches between total_supply and total_borrow based on option - can option be manipulated to use wrong total? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [User Balance Type] The function switches between user_effective_supply and user_effective_borrow - can these be mixed up causing incorrect rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Supply/Borrow Mixing] The function calculates both supply and borrow in one call (line 30) - can rewards be claimed for both simultaneously in ways not intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Effective Balance Source] The function uses get_effective_balance from incentive_v3 module - can effective balance differ from actual balance in exploitable ways? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Total Balance Accuracy] Total_supply and total_borrow are used for global calculations - are these guaranteed to be sum of all user effective balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Balance Consistency] User effective balance is calculated outside this function - can there be mismatch between when balance is read vs when rewards are calculated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Claimed Rewards Retrieval] The function gets user_claimed_reward at line 40 - can this value be manipulated or incorrectly tracked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Total vs Claimed Comparison] Lines 42-46 compare total and claimed rewards - can integer overflow in total make it appear less than claimed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [Total Rewards Retrieval] User total rewards are retrieved at line 103 - is this value updated atomically with claimed rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Asset ID Validation] The function validates asset ID at line 65 - can malicious admin set wrong asset ID for rule? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Option Validation] The function validates option at line 69 - can option be changed after rule creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: verify_rule_id_config()] [Rule ID Uniqueness] Does rule_id need to be unique across all pools, or can same rule_id exist in different pools causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Module: incentive_v3_getter] [Read-Only Safety] The entire module is read-only (no state modifications) - can this be abused as oracle by malicious contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Module: incentive_v3_getter] [View Function Gas] The functions perform heavy computations - can attackers cause DoS by calling these repeatedly in view context? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Module: incentive_v3_getter] [Public API Surface] All helper functions are public - should some be internal to prevent misuse? (Low)"
