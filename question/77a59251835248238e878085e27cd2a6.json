  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Fee Balance Updates] After claiming spread fees, unclaimed_spread_fees and available_amount are both reduced. Can incorrect ordering of these operations cause accounting inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: join_fees()] [Unrestricted Fee Addition] The function allows joining any Balance<T> to fees without checks. Can malicious actors add dust amounts to manipulate fee-per-share calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: balances()] [Type Parameter Exploitation] Returns &Balances<P, T> using dynamic_field::borrow. Can an attacker call this with wrong T type to borrow incorrect balance data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: create_reserve()] [BalanceKey Collision] Uses BalanceKey{} as dynamic field key. Can other modules add fields with same key type, causing collision or overwrite? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: staker()] [Staker Dynamic Field Access] Borrows Staker<S> from dynamic field but doesn't validate S type matches reserve. Can wrong type parameter access wrong staker data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Struct: Balances] [Multiple Balance Types] Balances struct contains available_amount, fees, ctoken_fees, and deposited_ctokens. Can confusion between these balances lead to using wrong balance in operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: deposit_liquidity_and_mint_ctokens()] [Dual Limit Bypass] Checks both deposit_limit and deposit_limit_usd. Can an attacker deposit when one limit is near max but other has headroom, exploiting price volatility? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: deposit_liquidity_and_mint_ctokens()] [USD Limit with Upper Bound] Uses market_value_upper_bound for USD limit check. During high volatility, can this over-restrict deposits when actual price is lower? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: borrow_liquidity()] [Borrow Limit Check Timing] Borrow limits are checked after updating borrowed_amount. Can this allow temporary limit violation between check and state update? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Multiple Constraint Minimum] Takes min of available-MIN, token limit, and USD limit. Can one constraint being zero block legitimate borrows even when other limits have headroom? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: update_reserve_config()] [Config Hot Swap] The function uses cell::set to replace config and destroys old config. Can this create atomic inconsistency if operations are using old config during update? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: update_reserve_config()] [Malicious Config Values] No validation on new config values (e.g., extreme borrow_fee, negative interest rates). Can admin set config that breaks protocol invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: change_price_feed()] [Price Feed Change Without Price Update] Changes price_identifier but doesn't update actual price. Can this cause temporary price staleness or mismatch between identifier and price data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: deposit_ctokens()] [Deposited CToken Tracking] Joins ctokens to balances.deposited_ctokens. What is the purpose of this separate balance, and can it be exploited if not properly accounted for in total_supply? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: withdraw_ctokens()] [CToken Withdrawal Without Burn] Splits from deposited_ctokens without burning. Can this create duplicate ctoken supply that violates invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Struct: Balances] [CToken Supply vs Balance Mismatch] The ctoken_supply field tracks supply while ctoken_fees and deposited_ctokens track balances. Can inconsistency between these cause accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: create_reserve()] [Reward Manager Initialization] Creates deposits_pool_reward_manager and borrows_pool_reward_manager during creation. Are these properly synchronized with deposits/borrows throughout reserve lifecycle? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: deposits_pool_reward_manager_mut()] [Reward Manager Access] Returns mutable reference to reward manager. Can external code corrupt reward state by improper mutations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: borrows_pool_reward_manager_mut()] [Borrow Rewards Manipulation] Allows mutation of borrows reward manager. Can this be exploited to give borrowers artificial rewards, diluting lenders? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: log_reserve_data()] [Event Data Accuracy] Emits ReserveAssetDataEvent with market_value calculations. Can off-chain systems be manipulated if event data doesn't match actual state due to calculation errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: compound_interest()] [Interest Event Manipulation] Emits InterestUpdateEvent with USD estimates. Can attackers exploit timing of interest updates to create misleading event sequences for off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: ctoken_ratio()] [Ratio Calculation Edge Cases] When ctoken_supply is MIN_AVAILABLE_AMOUNT exactly and total_supply is large, can ratio become extremely high, causing issues in deposit/redeem calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: total_supply()] [Negative Supply Possibility] Subtracts unclaimed_spread_fees from available + borrowed. Can fee accounting bugs cause unclaimed_spread_fees to exceed total, resulting in underflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: market_value_lower_bound()] [Bound Inversion] Uses min(price, smoothed_price) for lower bound. During severe price drops, can this bound be too optimistic, allowing over-borrowing before liquidations trigger? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve.move] [Function: usd_to_token_amount_lower_bound()] [Price Bound Usage] Divides by price_upper_bound to get lower token amount. Can manipulated price bounds cause incorrect liquidation thresholds? (High)"
