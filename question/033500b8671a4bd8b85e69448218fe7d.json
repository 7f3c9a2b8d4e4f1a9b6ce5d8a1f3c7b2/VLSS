  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the friend-only access to manipulate version number arbitrarily, bypassing version checks in all other functions since version_migrate() has no additional constraints beyond friend access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_reward_fund()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call create_reward_fund() repeatedly with different generic types to create unlimited shared RewardFund objects without admin authorization, potentially causing storage bloat or state confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_reward_fund()] [Authorization Bypass] Does deposit_reward_fund() being friend-only prevent unauthorized deposits that could manipulate reward distribution ratios or cause accounting issues if malicious balances are added? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_reward_fund()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the friend-only withdraw_reward_fund() through a compromised friend module to drain all reward funds using std::u64::min() which allows partial withdrawals without proper authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_incentive_v3()] [Authorization Bypass] Does create_incentive_v3() being friend-only prevent creation of multiple incentive instances that could cause confusion in protocol state or allow unauthorized incentive schemes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit create_pool() being friend-only but without owner/admin cap checks to create pools for arbitrary assets and manipulate which assets receive incentives? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Authorization Bypass] Does create_rule() lack proper authorization beyond friend access, allowing creation of rules with arbitrary reward rates before max_rate is set, enabling infinite reward inflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_borrow_fee_rate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit set_borrow_fee_rate() being friend-only to repeatedly toggle fee rates between 0 and max (10%), front-running user borrows to extract maximum fees without proper governance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Authorization Bypass] Does withdraw_borrow_fee() being friend-only without recipient restrictions allow draining accumulated protocol fees to arbitrary addresses controlled by malicious friend modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_enable_by_rule_id()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit set_enable_by_rule_id() to disable reward rules right before users claim, causing claim failures and allowing attacker to front-run with their own claims while rules are enabled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Authorization Bypass] Does set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id() allow setting max_rate to 0 without validation, enabling later bypass of rate limits since the check 'rule.max_rate == 0 || rate <= rule.max_rate' treats 0 as unlimited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() to set reward rates immediately after users deposit but before update_reward_state is called, manipulating global index calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: version_verification()] [Version Control] Does version_verification() only check pre_check_version without validating version equality, allowing operations on incentive objects with outdated versions as long as they pass pre-check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Authorization] Does claim_reward() use tx_context::sender(ctx) without verifying the sender owns the account or has permission, potentially allowing unauthorized reward claims if ctx can be manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: claim_reward_with_account_cap()] [Authorization] Can an attacker exploit claim_reward_with_account_cap() by obtaining or forging an AccountCap to claim rewards belonging to other users if account_owner() validation is insufficient? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_deposit()] [Authorization] Does entry_deposit() allow deposits on behalf of arbitrary users without proper authorization checks, enabling attacker to inflate other users' balances and manipulate reward calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_with_account_cap()] [Authorization] Can an attacker exploit deposit_with_account_cap() by reusing or replaying AccountCap signatures to deposit repeatedly without proper nonce or timestamp checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_deposit_on_behalf_of_user()] [Authorization] Does entry_deposit_on_behalf_of_user() accept arbitrary 'user' address parameter without validating the sender's authority, enabling forced deposits that manipulate reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_withdraw()] [Authorization] Can an attacker front-run entry_withdraw() calls to update reward states with malicious parameters before the legitimate withdrawal, stealing accrued rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_with_account_cap()] [Authorization] Does withdraw_with_account_cap() validate that the AccountCap hasn't been revoked or is still active before allowing withdrawals that affect reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_borrow()] [Authorization] Can an attacker exploit entry_borrow() to borrow on behalf of other users by manipulating tx_context if the sender validation is weak, causing unauthorized debt? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: borrow_with_account_cap()] [Authorization] Does borrow_with_account_cap() properly validate AccountCap ownership before allowing borrows that trigger borrow fee collection and reward updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_repay()] [Authorization] Can an attacker exploit entry_repay() to repay other users' debts without authorization, manipulating their reward calculations and borrow positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: entry_repay_on_behalf_of_user()] [Authorization] Does entry_repay_on_behalf_of_user() lack proper authorization checks allowing anyone to repay any user's debt, potentially griefing users who strategically maintain debt for reward farming? (Low)",
