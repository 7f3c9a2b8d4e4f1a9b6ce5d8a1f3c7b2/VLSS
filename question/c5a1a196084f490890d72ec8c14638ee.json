  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Negative Price Handling] The comment at line 55 states 'suilend doesn't support negative prices' but only calls get_magnitude_if_positive - does this abort on negative prices or return 0, and could this be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [External Dependency] Does the function validate that the PriceInfoObject is from the legitimate Pyth contract, or can attackers pass malicious PriceInfoObjects with fabricated prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Signature Verification] Are Pyth price signatures verified before use, or does the function assume price_info_obj has already been validated, potentially accepting unverified price data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Price Feed Matching] Is the price_identifier returned at line 25 used to verify that the price corresponds to the expected asset, or could callers misuse prices for wrong assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Reentrancy] Can the price_info_obj be mutated by the caller between validation and use, allowing time-of-check-time-of-use attacks where price data changes after validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [DoS Attack] If Pyth price feeds stop updating for >60s due to oracle node issues, will all vault operations dependent on this oracle permanently fail until Pyth recovers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Error Handling] The function returns option::none() for invalid spot prices (lines 37, 47) - do callers have proper fallback logic, or could None values propagate causing unexpected behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Silent Failure] When confidence or staleness checks fail, the function returns None without emitting events - can this silent failure be exploited to hide oracle manipulation attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Tuple Return] The function returns a 3-tuple (Option<Decimal>, Decimal, PriceIdentifier) - can callers accidentally swap the order of return values, using EMA as spot or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Inconsistent State] If spot price validation fails but EMA is returned successfully, could vault operations use inconsistent pricing where some components use EMA and others expect spot? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Module: oracles] [Dependency Risk] Does the suilend::decimal module used for mul/div operations at lines 60-68 have its own overflow/underflow protections, or could those operations fail silently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Type Safety] Are the pyth::price and pyth::price_feed types from the official Pyth contract, or could a malicious fork provide compatible types with altered validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Module: oracles] [Version Compatibility] If the Pyth protocol upgrades its price feed format or validation logic, could this oracle module become incompatible, permanently breaking Suilend and Volo vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Clock Dependency] Does the function validate that the Clock object is the system Clock, or could callers pass a manipulated Clock with arbitrary timestamps? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Edge Case] What happens if price_mag is u64::MAX and conf is also u64::MAX? Does the confidence check handle this boundary correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Edge Case] If timestamp_ms is exactly at the rollover point (e.g., changing from 1699999999 to 1700000000), could the division by 1000 cause off-by-one errors in staleness calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Edge Case] What is the maximum supported price_mag value before decimal::from() fails? Can extremely large prices (e.g., for high-value assets) cause conversion errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Edge Case] For expo values near i64::MIN or i64::MAX, do the magnitude extraction functions handle these boundaries correctly without overflowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Edge Case] If multiple validation checks fail simultaneously (both confidence and staleness), which check executes first, and could the ordering be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Gas Exhaustion] Can the std::u64::pow(10, expo) calculations at lines 62 and 67 consume excessive gas for large exponents, making oracle price fetches prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [DoS] If called repeatedly with invalid prices, could the repeated option::none() returns combined with caller retry logic create a DoS condition? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Economic Attack] During extreme market volatility, can attackers trigger the confidence check to fail by waiting for periods when Pyth confidence intervals naturally widen, causing DoS on vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Constant: MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO] [Governance Risk] The MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO constant is hardcoded with no upgrade path - if market conditions change requiring different confidence thresholds, must the entire module be replaced? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Integer Math] Does the confidence check `conf * MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO > price_mag` correctly implement the intended '10% of price' logic, or should it be `conf * 100 > price_mag * 10` for better precision? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Timestamp Precision] Converting timestamp_ms to seconds by dividing by 1000 (line 42) loses millisecond precision - could two prices 500ms apart be treated as simultaneous? (Low)"
