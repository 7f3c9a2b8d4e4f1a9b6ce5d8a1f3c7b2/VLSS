  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: guardian_queue()] [Guardian Validation] If guardian_queue is used for price feed validation - could setting invalid ID disable critical price sanity checks allowing oracle manipulation attacks on vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [Price Feed Switch] Changing oracle_queue mid-operation - could oracle ID swap during vault operation cause pre-op and post-op prices to come from different sources, violating value consistency checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [Global State] Single shared State for all oracle consumers - could State mutation by one vault affect oracle reads by other vaults, creating cross-vault attack vectors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Access Control] No role-based access control beyond package visibility - should there be separate roles for oracle_queue vs guardian_queue updates to limit blast radius of key compromise? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Emergency Controls] No emergency pause or freeze mechanism - if oracle_queue is compromised, how can system halt price feeds before vault operations consume bad data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Validation Logic] No integrity checks on ID references - should setters verify IDs point to objects with expected types/capabilities before storing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Version Control] No package version tracking beyond on_demand_package_id - could oracle queue implement incompatible interface changes breaking consumer contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Event System] No events emitted for any state changes - how do off-chain monitors detect oracle source changes or guardian rotations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: set_oracle_queue_id(), set_guardian_queue_id()] [ID Collision] No check preventing oracle_queue and guardian_queue from being set to same ID - could setting both to same object cause logical confusion or enable single-point-of-failure attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Circular Reference] Could on_demand_package_id be set to self-reference creating circular dependency in package resolution logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization Order] If dependent vaults deploy in same transaction, could they read State before AdminCap holder calls setters, operating with zero-address oracle references? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Multi-Step Setup] Initialization requires separate setter calls after init - could admin forget to call setters leaving system permanently in uninitialized state with zero IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Key Management] AdminCap transferred to ctx.sender() with no multi-sig or governance - could single key compromise allow attacker to modify oracle/guardian sources via package-internal calls? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: AdminCap] [Capability Transfer] AdminCap has key ability allowing transfer - could stolen/leaked AdminCap be transferred to attacker without revocation mechanism? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: AdminCap] [Single Admin] Only one AdminCap created in init - if lost or sent to burn address, could system become permanently frozen with no way to update IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Package Isolation] As local dependency, any module in volo-vault package can call setters - could malicious adaptors or vault logic directly manipulate oracle sources? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Trust Boundary] Setters assume caller is trusted package member - if volo-vault package includes third-party modules, could they abuse package visibility? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: oracle_queue(), set_oracle_queue_id()] [Read-Write Race] Getters have no locking - could concurrent setter call during getter execution return inconsistent oracle_queue mid-update? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: guardian_queue(), set_guardian_queue_id()] [State Coherence] No read barrier between getter call and actual oracle use - could guardian_queue ID change between read and validation causing TOCTOU vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Zero Address] All IDs initialized to 0x00 address - is zero-address a valid sentinel value or could it be confused with actual object ID in dependent logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: set_oracle_queue_id(), set_guardian_queue_id(), set_on_demand_package_id()] [Reset Attack] Could malicious package module reset IDs back to zero to disable oracle/guardian checks temporarily? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [Object Deletion] State has key but no drop - could State object be deleted/wrapped breaking all oracle consumers' references? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Single Instance] Only one State created in init - could multiple instances be created if init called multiple times in test/upgrade scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Price Source] Returned ID used for Switchboard price queries - if ID points to manipulated oracle, could all vault value calculations be compromised without detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [Oracle Rotation] No cooldown or transition period when changing oracle_queue - could immediate switch cause price discontinuity breaking vault loss_tolerance checks? (High)"
