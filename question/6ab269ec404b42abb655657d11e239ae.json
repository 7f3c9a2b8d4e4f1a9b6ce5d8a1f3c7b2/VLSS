  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: migrate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call migrate() multiple times to manipulate version state, bypassing version checks in other functions by setting version > CURRENT_VERSION, then reverting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Initialization Vulnerability] Can the initial rate_limiter configuration with window_duration=1 and max_outflow=U64_MAX be exploited to drain all reserves immediately after market creation before owner updates config? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: migrate()] [Version Validation] Does the migration allow upgrading from version (CURRENT_VERSION - 2) or older versions without proper state migration, potentially leaving incompatible data structures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: refresh_reserve_price()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker frontrun refresh_reserve_price() with stale price data from Pyth to manipulate collateral valuations before borrowing/liquidating? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Stale Oracle] Is there a race condition where reserve::assert_price_is_fresh() passes but the price becomes stale before obligation::borrow() executes, allowing borrowing with outdated collateral values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: refresh_reserve_price()] [Array Index] Can reserve_array_index be out-of-bounds if reserves vector is modified concurrently, causing panic or allowing price updates to wrong reserve? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Oracle Freshness] Does liquidate() properly verify that ALL reserve prices (both repay and withdraw reserves) are fresh via obligation::refresh(), or can liquidation occur with partially stale prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: redeem_ctokens_and_withdraw_liquidity_request()] [Rate Limiter Bypass] Can an attacker bypass rate limiting by creating multiple small redemption requests that each stay under the threshold but collectively drain reserves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Rate Limiter Exemption] Can liquidators abuse RateLimiterExemption by repeatedly liquidating tiny positions to accumulate exemptions, then redeem large amounts bypassing rate limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Rate Limiter] Does rate_limiter::process_qty() use market_value_upper_bound for borrows - can an attacker exploit price volatility by borrowing when upper bound is artificially low? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: redeem_ctokens_and_withdraw_liquidity_request()] [Exemption Logic] If exemption.amount >= ctoken_amount, the full amount is exempt - can attacker split a large exemption into multiple redemptions, reusing the same exemption multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: update_rate_limiter_config()] [Configuration Attack] Can owner set rate_limiter window_duration to 0 or max_outflow to 0, effectively blocking all borrows/redemptions and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: create_obligation()] [Obligation Tracking] Does adding obligation to object_table ensure unique IDs - can a collision attack create two obligations with same ID, allowing unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Cap Validation] Does obligation_owner_cap.obligation_id match the obligation in object_table - can an attacker use a cap from a different lending market to access obligations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: withdraw_ctokens()] [Stale Oracle Check] obligation::refresh() returns exist_stale_oracles but withdraw() is called with this flag - does withdraw properly reject if ANY oracle is stale, or can partial stale oracles allow over-withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: new_obligation_owner_cap()] [Cap Creation] Can admin create multiple ObligationOwnerCaps for same obligation_id, allowing multiple parties to control the same obligation and drain collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Direct Obligation Access] liquidate() takes obligation_id directly without requiring ObligationOwnerCap - can this be exploited to liquidate healthy positions by manipulating price oracles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_liquidity_and_mint_ctokens()] [Minimum Check] assert!(coin::value(&deposit) > 0) and assert!(balance::value(&ctokens) > 0) - can deposits of 1 unit cause rounding to 0 ctokens, burning user funds without minting anything? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: redeem_ctokens_and_withdraw_liquidity_request()] [Zero Amount Check] assert!(reserve::liquidity_request_amount(&liquidity_request) > 0) - can redeeming tiny ctoken amounts result in 0 liquidity but still consume ctokens due to rounding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_ctokens_into_obligation_by_id()] [Type Verification] Type checking happens AFTER reserve lookup - can wrong reserve_array_index cause deposit into wrong reserve type before EWrongType fires? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: withdraw_ctokens()] [Max Withdrawal] When amount == U64_MAX, max_withdraw_amount() is calculated - can this calculation underflow or return incorrect value if obligation has no deposits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_ctokens_into_obligation()] [Event Before State] DepositEvent is emitted before obligation::deposit() and reserve::deposit_ctokens() - can transaction revert after event emission, causing off-chain state inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Max Borrow Calculation] When amount == U64_MAX, max_borrow_amount() calculates remaining capacity - does this account for origination fees, or can borrower exceed actual liquidity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Fee Calculation] reserve::liquidity_request_fee() is emitted in event but not validated - can reserve return incorrect fee amount, causing accounting mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Interest Compounding] reserve::compound_interest() is called before borrow - if time delta is very large, can interest calculation overflow and revert, causing DoS? (Medium)"
