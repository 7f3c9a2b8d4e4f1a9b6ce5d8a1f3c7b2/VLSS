  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Interest Rate Update] The function calls logic::update_interest_rate() after cumulating to supply index - if the interest rate calculation depends on total supply, could flash loan volume artificially inflate or deflate rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Supply Index Manipulation] The scaled_fee_to_supplier calculation uses ray_div() with supply_index - if supply_index is 0 or very small, could this cause division by zero or extreme scaling? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Normal Amount Calculation] The call to pool::normal_amount(_pool, fee_to_supplier) might transform the fee - if this transformation has rounding errors, can repeated flash loans accumulate significant discrepancies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Ray Math Overflow] When calling ray_math::ray_div((normal_amount as u256), supply_index), if normal_amount is very large, could the u256 casting or division overflow or produce unexpected results? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Asset ID Mismatch] The function calls get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type() which iterates all reserves - if the coin type isn't found, it aborts, but could race conditions cause the asset ID to change between loan() and repay()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Storage State Update] The function calls logic::update_state_of_all() at the beginning - if this is expensive and an attacker flash loans many times, could this cause DoS through gas exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Treasury Deposit] The fee_to_treasury is deposited via pool::deposit_treasury() - if this function fails or has vulnerabilities, could fees be lost or stolen? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Deposit Balance] The main repayment uses pool::deposit_balance() with _user parameter - if pool accounting ties this to the user, could an attacker repay with one user's funds but credit another user? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Return Value] The function returns remaining _repay_balance - if caller doesn't properly handle this return value, could excess funds be lost or locked? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Event Emission] The FlashRepay event is emitted after all operations - if any operation fails, the event isn't emitted, but could partial state changes persist causing accounting mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Receipt Destruction] The receipt is destructured and consumed - but if an attacker can clone or duplicate the receipt struct before calling repay(), could they repay multiple times with different balances? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Linear Search] The function iterates through all reserves in O(n) - can an attacker with many asset types cause DoS by forcing expensive lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Off-by-One] The loop starts with count and decrements to 0, checking id = count - 1 - could this miss the asset at index 0 or cause an underflow if count is 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [String Comparison] The comparison uses this_type == t for string equality - if there are unicode normalization issues or case sensitivity, could legitimate types fail to match? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Abort Behavior] If the asset isn't found, the function aborts with error::reserve_not_found() - could an admin accidentally delete an asset from storage but leave it in flash loan config, causing all repayments to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Race Condition] Between loan() checking the flash loan config and repay() checking storage, if the storage reserves change, could this cause repayment failures and locked funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: parsed_receipt()] [Information Disclosure] This public function exposes all receipt details including fees - could an attacker use this to extract strategy information or front-run based on fee structures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_asset()] [Reserve Check] The function checks support_assets but if the asset was removed between check and access, could this cause a panic or return stale data? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_asset()] [Data Exposure] This public function exposes internal config including pool_id and rates - could attackers use this to identify misconfigured pools or plan exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Friend Access] This is friend-only but could a compromised friend module call this repeatedly to manipulate rates during active flash loans? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Active Loans] If rates are changed while receipts are outstanding, users who borrowed at old rates might repay at new rates - could this cause underpayment or overpayment? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Verification Timing] The function calls verify_config() after updating the rate - if verify_config() fails, is the rate rolled back or does partial state persist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Combined Rate Limit] The verify_config() checks rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury < FlashLoanMultiple(), but if both setters are called in the same transaction, could they bypass the check individually? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Treasury Manipulation] Could a malicious admin set rate_to_treasury to maximum allowed value, effectively routing all fees to treasury and none to suppliers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_min()] [Min to Zero] Can an admin set min to 0, allowing zero-amount flash loans that might break downstream assumptions about non-zero balances? (Medium)"
