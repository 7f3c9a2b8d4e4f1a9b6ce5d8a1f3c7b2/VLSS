  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: new()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker create unlimited Hasher instances without cleanup since the struct has 'drop' and 'copy' abilities, potentially leading to memory exhaustion in a loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: new()] [State Initialization] Does the empty buffer initialization guarantee sufficient capacity for large messages, or could vector reallocation overhead be exploited in DoS scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: finalize()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft different input sequences that produce identical SHA2-256 hashes by manipulating the order of push operations, bypassing signature verification? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: finalize()] [Reference Safety] Does the function take a reference to self instead of consuming it, allowing the same Hasher to be finalized multiple times with different signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: finalize()] [Malleability] Can the buffer be modified between finalize() calls if the Hasher is copied before finalization, creating signature malleability issues? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u32()] [Endianness Confusion] Does the big-endian conversion via vector::reverse() correctly handle BCS encoding edge cases, or can attacker craft inputs where reversed bytes create unintended values?

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u32_le()] [Consistency Violation] Since push_u32_le uses little-endian while push_u32 uses big-endian, can mixing these in message generation cause verification failures with off-chain oracle signers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u32_le()] [Vector Mutation] Does append() safely handle the bytes vector, or could concurrent modifications (if possible) corrupt the buffer state? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u64()] [Timestamp Manipulation] For timestamp fields, can an attacker exploit endianness differences to create future-dated or past-dated signatures by manually reversing bytes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u64_le()] [BCS Format Dependency] Does the little-endian format exactly match off-chain oracle implementations, or could subtle encoding differences cause valid signatures to fail verification? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/hash.move] [Function: push_u64_le()] [Replay Attack Vector] If timestamps use push_u64_le but are not monotonically increasing, can old oracle signatures be replayed with manipulated timestamp bytes? (High)",
