  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: init()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call init() multiple times in different transactions to create multiple PoolAdminCap instances, allowing unauthorized admin access to pool operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the friend-only restriction on create_pool() prevent malicious contracts from becoming friends and creating unauthorized pools with manipulated decimal values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Privilege Escalation] Can an attacker who obtains a PoolAdminCap reference through shared object manipulation drain the treasury_balance without proper authorization checks beyond cap ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Authorization Inconsistency] Why is withdraw_reserve_balance() marked as friend-only when it requires PoolAdminCap, and can this dual restriction be bypassed by a malicious friend module ignoring the cap parameter? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: PoolAdminCap] [Ownership Transfer] Can the PoolAdminCap be transferred to an untrusted address after init(), and if so, does the creator field check provide any meaningful protection in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Friend Trust Model] Can a compromised friend module (lending, storage, or flash_loan) call deposit() to inflate pool.balance without corresponding user deposits, breaking accounting invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Friend Trust Model] Can a malicious friend module call withdraw() repeatedly in a single transaction to drain the pool before balance checks are enforced elsewhere? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_balance()] [User Impersonation] Can a friend module call deposit_balance() with an arbitrary user address parameter, emitting false PoolDeposit events and breaking audit trails? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [User Impersonation] Can a friend module specify any user address in withdraw_balance(), allowing withdrawal on behalf of users without their consent and bypassing higher-level access controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Module: lending_core::pool] [Friend Declaration] Are the friend modules (lending, storage, flash_loan) implemented with sufficient access controls to prevent them from abusing their privileged access to pool operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Type Parameter Exploitation] Can an attacker create multiple Pool<CoinType> instances for the same CoinType with different decimal values, causing decimal conversion confusion in dependent modules? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Dual Authorization] If both PoolAdminCap and friend access are required, can an attacker obtain the cap reference without being a friend module, or vice versa, to bypass intended restrictions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: Pool] [Object Sharing] Since Pool is a shared object, can concurrent transactions from different friend modules race to manipulate balance and treasury_balance, causing accounting inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: init()] [Single Initialization] Is there a guarantee that init() is called only once per module deployment, or can module upgrades trigger additional init() calls creating duplicate PoolAdminCap instances? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Mutable Cap Reference] Does accepting &mut PoolAdminCap instead of &PoolAdminCap allow state modifications to the cap that could bypass authorization in subsequent calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Missing Authorization] Why does deposit_treasury() lack any authorization checks (no cap, friend-only but called by whom?), allowing any friend module to move funds from balance to treasury_balance arbitrarily? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Decimal Validation] Does create_pool() validate that the decimal parameter is within safe bounds (0-18), or can a malicious admin create pools with extreme decimals causing overflow in convert_amount()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Module: lending_core::pool] [Friend Expansion] If the module is upgraded to add more friend modules, can new friends retroactively access existing pools without the original creator's consent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Recipient Validation] Does withdraw() validate the recipient address, or can a friend module send funds to address(0), burning tokens and reducing pool TVL? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Recipient Validation] Can withdraw_reserve_balance() transfer funds to an arbitrary recipient controlled by the cap holder, potentially extracting value from the pool against protocol rules? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: PoolAdminCap] [Creator Field Usage] Is the creator field in PoolAdminCap ever checked in any function, or is it purely informational, meaning cap ownership is the only authorization mechanism? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Coin Value Extraction] Can deposit() be called with a Coin<CoinType> that has zero value, wasting gas and emitting misleading events without actual fund transfers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Zero-Value Bypass] Does the zero-value check in withdraw_balance() prevent balance underflow, or can it be exploited in combination with other operations to manipulate accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Assertion Bypass] Can the assertion in deposit_treasury() be bypassed if pool.balance is manipulated by concurrent friend module calls in the same transaction epoch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Assertion Bypass] Can the assertion in withdraw_treasury() be bypassed through flash loan manipulation, where treasury_balance is temporarily increased and withdrawn in the same transaction? (High)"
