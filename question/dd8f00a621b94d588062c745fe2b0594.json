(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Staleness] If oracle_validity_length_ms is set to very large value at line 73, can old price submissions from pre-volatility periods be used during market crashes, causing vaults to use stale prices and suffer incorrect liquidations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Data Gap] If min_attestations increases suddenly at line 51, will in-progress oracle aggregations with fewer attestations fail, creating price data gaps that halt vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Incentive] If fee becomes too low relative to gas costs, will oracles stop submitting data? Does validation check fee >= minimum_viable_fee to ensure oracle sustainability? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Quality] No validation that new configs maintain oracle data quality standards. Can authority set parameters that technically work but produce low-quality data (e.g., min_attestations=1, validity=1 year)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Reference Type] validate() takes &Queue at line 28 but actuate() takes &mut Queue at line 40.

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Ownership] If queue.set_configs() at line 47 requires exclusive ownership but queue is shared object with multiple concurrent accessors, can config updates fail unpredictably, causing inconsistent oracle system state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Version Cache] Does queue.version() at line 33 read from cached value or fresh state? Can stale cache cause version check to pass for upgraded queue, bypassing version safety? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Initialization] If run() is called on uninitialized or partially-initialized queue, will validation at lines 33-36 catch this, or can corrupt config be written to uninitialized queue? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Name Length] name parameter at line 69 is String with no length validation. Can excessively long names (megabytes) cause gas exhaustion, storage bloat, or DoS when queue configs are read? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Injection] If name at line 48 contains special characters or escape sequences used in off-chain parsing, can malicious names break indexers or monitoring tools?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Empty] Can name be empty string? Will this cause issues in UIs or off-chain systems expecting non-empty queue identifiers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Name Change Tracking] Changing name at line 48 doesn't preserve old name history.
