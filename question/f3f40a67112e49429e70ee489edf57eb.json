  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Address Validation] Similar to transfer_owner, can transferring OperatorCap to an invalid address (0x0, non-existent, contract without receive) cause permanent loss of operator privileges with no owner recovery mechanism? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Authorization Gap] The function allows any holder of OperatorCap to transfer it - should there be additional authorization requiring OwnerCap approval before operator transfer, or is unrestricted transfer intentional? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Reentrancy] During transfer::transfer(cap, to), could the 'to' address's receive logic call back into protocol functions that assume the old operator still holds OperatorCap, causing state inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Event Accuracy] If OperatorCap transfer fails mid-execution, is the OperatorCapTransferred event rolled back, or could it persist causing off-chain tracking errors? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Sender Spoofing] The event uses tx_context::sender(ctx) as 'from' - if the actual OperatorCap holder uses a proxy or delegated transaction, does this cause event inaccuracy enabling operator tracking bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Self-Transfer Loop] Can an attacker repeatedly call transfer_operator with 'to' set to their own address to spam OperatorCapTransferred events, causing off-chain indexer DoS or storage bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Race Conditions] If operator transfer happens concurrently with operator-privileged actions (stake, unstake, config changes), which transaction order is enforced, and could this enable privilege escalation timing attacks? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Capability Theft] Could an attacker frontrun a legitimate transfer_operator transaction to steal the OperatorCap transfer to themselves instead of the intended recipient? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Missing Cooldown] Is there any rate limiting or cooldown period on operator transfers, or can the operator be changed arbitrarily often, enabling rapid privilege switching attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Function: transfer_operator()] [Event Indexing] Do off-chain systems correctly handle rapid OperatorCapTransferred events, or could high-frequency transfers cause indexing errors and incorrect operator tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OwnerCapTransferred] [Event Manipulation] Since the event has 'copy, drop' abilities, could an attacker create fake OwnerCapTransferred events off-chain and inject them into event streams to trick monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OwnerCapTransferred] [Missing Timestamp] The event doesn't include a timestamp field - could this cause ambiguity in event ordering when multiple transfers occur in the same block? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OwnerCapTransferred] [Missing UID] The event doesn't include the OwnerCap's UID - if multiple OwnerCap instances exist (via exploit), can off-chain systems distinguish which specific capability was transferred? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OwnerCapTransferred] [Address Collision] If 'from' and 'to' addresses are identical (self-transfer), does this cause event processing errors in systems that assume transfers always change ownership? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OwnerCapTransferred] [Event Spamming] Can an attacker with OwnerCap spam transfer events by transferring back and forth to cause off-chain event indexer DoS or storage exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OperatorCapTransferred] [Event Forgery] Similar to OwnerCapTransferred, could fake OperatorCapTransferred events be injected into off-chain systems to cause incorrect operator privilege tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OperatorCapTransferred] [Missing Metadata] The event lacks metadata about why the transfer occurred (voluntary, forced, migration) - does this ambiguity cause security monitoring gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OperatorCapTransferred] [Event Correlation] Without a unique transfer ID, can multiple OperatorCapTransferred events be correlated to the same underlying capability object, or could event replay cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Struct: OperatorCapTransferred] [Cross-Event Sync] If OwnerCapTransferred and OperatorCapTransferred are emitted in the same transaction, is their ordering guaranteed, or could off-chain systems process them out of order causing race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Capability Validation] Do other protocol modules (stake_pool, manage, fee_config) verify that OwnerCap/OperatorCap originate from this specific ownership module, or could capabilities from a malicious fork module be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Capability Revocation] If OwnerCap is transferred to a malicious actor, do other modules provide emergency pause or revocation mechanisms that don't require OwnerCap, or is the protocol permanently compromised? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Operator Privilege Scope] Do other modules clearly distinguish between owner-only actions (fee config, pause) and operator-allowed actions (stake, unstake), or could OperatorCap be used to execute owner-level functions? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Missing Timelock] When OwnerCap is transferred, do critical protocol functions (fee changes, validator updates) have a timelock to prevent immediate malicious actions by the new owner? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Capability Enumeration] Can external modules query the current holder of OwnerCap/OperatorCap for access control decisions, or is capability ownership opaque enabling privilege confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/ownership.move] [Module Integration] [Emergency Override] Is there a governance or multisig mechanism that can override or replace OwnerCap/OperatorCap in case of compromise, or is the single-key model a permanent single point of failure? (Critical)"
