  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Operation Timing] Can an attacker observe a pending vault start_operation() transaction in mempool, front-run it with run() to set max_variance=MAX_U64 allowing manipulated prices, execute their exploit, then restore configs before the operation ends? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Deposit Manipulation] Can an attacker: 1) monitor for large vault deposits, 2) front-run with run() setting min_sample_size=1, 3) use single compromised oracle to inflate asset price, 4) depositor gets fewer shares than deserved? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Withdrawal Exploit] Can an attacker: 1) front-run withdrawal with run() setting max_variance=MAX_U64, 2) manipulate oracle to show deflated prices, 3) withdrawer receives fewer assets than shares should represent, 4) attacker profits from the difference? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Price Manipulation] If vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus) rely on this aggregator for price feeds, can config manipulation cause adaptors to report incorrect asset values, violating vault's total_usd_value invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] Can an attacker set configs to make oracle report no valid results (min_sample_size=MAX_U64), causing vault operations to skip loss_tolerance checks due to missing price data, allowing unauthorized losses? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Parameter Attack] Can combining min_sample_size=2, max_variance=1, max_staleness_seconds=1, min_responses=50 create a practically impossible-to-satisfy state where two samples must be within 1 variance unit, less than 1 second old, and require 50 oracle responses? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Dependency Chain] If feed_hash points to a feed that requires specific min_responses but that value is set lower in this config, can oracle feed validation reject all updates even though aggregator config validation passed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Migration Path] If aggregators need to migrate from version 1 to version 2, does the version check at line 41 prevent any config updates on v2 aggregators until this module is upgraded, creating a dangerous window? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Backward Compatibility] If EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION is changed in a package upgrade, can existing transactions in-flight that validated against old version fail when applied against new aggregators? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Rollback] If Aggregator module adds a vulnerability fix in version 2 but this action still accepts version 1, can attackers continue exploiting v1 aggregators while new ones are safe? (Medium)",
