  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Queue Reference Lock] Taking &Queue reference might lock guardian queue temporarily. Can attacker chain many run() calls to keep guardian queue locked, preventing legitimate operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Address Type Assumptions] authority and fee_recipient are address type. In Sui, addresses can be account addresses or object IDs. Can confusion between these cause routing issues where fees go to objects instead of accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [u64 Type Limits] All numeric parameters are u64. Can overflow when queue module performs arithmetic or casts to smaller types (u32/u16/u8) causing truncation of critical values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [ID Type Safety] queue_id is returned as ID type. Can queue::new() return invalid ID that passes type check but causes crashes when used to look up queue object? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [String Type Constraints] name is String type which in Move has specific encoding. Can attacker pass invalid UTF-8 causing panics in string operations downstream? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Reference Type] Takes &Queue but doesn't verify it's an initialized Queue object. Can attacker pass zero-initialized memory or wrong object type that happens to have version() method? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Constant Usage] Uses error constants like EInvalidQueueVersion but no error codes. Can this make debugging difficult for users, or enable attacker to hide specific failure reasons? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert Without Recovery] All validations use assert! causing full transaction revert. Is there no partial success path or refund mechanism if user made honest mistake in parameters? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Return Value] Entry function returns nothing. How does caller confirm queue was created successfully? Can this hide failures or enable attacker to deceive users about queue status? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [queue::new() Error Propagation] If queue::new() has internal errors that don't abort, will they propagate correctly or be silently ignored leaving invalid queue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Failure] If event::emit() fails (e.g., due to event system limits), does transaction abort or continue with queue created but no event? Would this break monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Constant Migration] EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1. When guardian queues upgrade to v2, this contract becomes useless. Is there migration path or will Volo Vault lose ability to create new oracles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Semantic Changes] If queue module changes meaning of parameters (e.g., fee from absolute to percentage), existing code will pass wrong values. Is there version negotiation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Boolean Parameter Hardcoding] Passes 'false' as 8th parameter. If semantic changes (false now means 'allow duplicates'), does this break intended behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Module Level] [Immutable Module] Move modules are typically immutable. If vulnerabilities are found, can contract be upgraded or will all queues created by this version remain vulnerable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Queue Backward Compatibility] If guardian queue downgrades or has version() method removed, will all queue creation fail causing complete DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Module Level] [Queue Module Trust] Imports switchboard::queue and calls its functions directly. If queue module is compromised or has bugs, all queues created via this module inherit those vulnerabilities. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Module Level] [Event Module Dependency] Uses sui::event for emissions. If event module has upgrade that breaks API, will queue creation fail due to event emission errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Module Level] [String Import] Uses std::string::String. If String implementation changes in stdlib, can this break name parameter handling causing queue creation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Module Level] [Circular Dependencies] Module depends on queue which might depend back on actions. Can circular dependencies cause initialization deadlocks or upgrade ordering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Trust Bootstrap] If Volo Vault auto-trusts queues from this module, can attacker create malicious queue that gets automatically whitelisted, enabling price manipulation attacks on vault? (Critical)",
