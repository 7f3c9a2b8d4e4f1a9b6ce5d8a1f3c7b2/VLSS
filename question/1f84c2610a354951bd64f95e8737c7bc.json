  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Event: FeeCollectedEvent] [Implementation Risk] When fee() is implemented, could the function fail to emit FeeCollectedEvent, breaking event-based monitoring and indexing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Event: CollectPoolRewardEvent] [Implementation Risk] When reward() is implemented, could the function emit events with incorrect position_id or pool_id, causing off-chain tracking errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Event: FeeCollectedEvent] [Reentrancy Risk] When implemented, could fee collection trigger external calls that re-enter and emit duplicate events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Event: CollectPoolRewardEvent] [Data Integrity] When implemented, could the event emission happen before actual coin transfer, creating event-reality mismatch if transfer fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Type Safety] The generic types <X, Y> must match Pool token types - when implemented, could type parameter confusion allow extraction of wrong token types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Type Safety] The generic type <R> for reward must match pool reward configuration - when implemented, could lack of type validation allow arbitrary token extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Module: collect] [Type Safety] Could the type_name::TypeName in CollectPoolRewardEvent be manipulated to incorrectly report reward types? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [State Mutation] The function takes &mut Pool<X, Y> - when implemented, could improper state updates leave the pool in an inconsistent state after fee collection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [State Mutation] The function takes &mut Position - when implemented, could position state updates be incomplete, allowing double fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [State Mutation] When implemented, could the mutable pool reference enable unauthorized pool parameter modifications during reward collection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [State Mutation] When implemented, could the mutable position reference enable privilege escalation by modifying position ownership during collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Arithmetic Risk] When implemented, could fee calculation overflow with large liquidity positions, causing transaction abort or incorrect fee amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Arithmetic Risk] When implemented, could reward accrual calculations underflow with very small reward rates, causing users to receive no rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Precision Loss] When implemented, could integer division in fee calculations cause systematic rounding errors that accumulate over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Precision Loss] When implemented, could reward rate calculations lose precision with long time periods, shortchanging liquidity providers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Transaction Context] The TxContext parameter provides sender address - when implemented, could sender validation be missing, allowing anyone to trigger fee collection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Transaction Context] When implemented, could the ctx parameter be misused to send collected rewards to the wrong recipient? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: fee()] [Gas Optimization] When implemented, could inefficient fee collection logic cause transactions to exceed gas limits with large positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/collect.move] [Function: reward()] [Gas Optimization] When implemented, could reward collection from multiple reward types in sequence cause gas exhaustion? (Low)"
