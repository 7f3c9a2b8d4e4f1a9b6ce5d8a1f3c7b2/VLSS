  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_withdraw()] [Borrow Index Zero] If current_borrow_index at line 40 is zero, ray_mul at line 43 produces scale_borrow_balance=0, allowing withdrawals even when borrows exist? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_withdraw()] [Supply vs Borrow Mismatch] Can scale_supply_balance and scale_borrow_balance be manipulated independently such that line 45 check passes but actual withdrawal depletes reserves needed for borrows? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_withdraw()] [Exact Balance Edge Case] If scale_supply_balance exactly equals scale_borrow_balance + amount, the >= check at line 45 passes, but does this leave zero buffer for reserve requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_withdraw()] [Flash Withdrawal Attack] Can an attacker borrow maximum amount in same transaction before validate_withdraw() is called, causing line 45 assertion to fail and DoS legitimate withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Coin Type Spoofing] Can CoinType generic at line 56 be crafted to pass type_name string match at line 57 but represent different value or wrapped asset? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Zero Borrow Bypass] While zero amount is blocked at line 58, can amount=1 or minimal amounts be borrowed repeatedly to manipulate borrow index or cause precision errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Amount Overflow] If amount at line 56 is near u256::MAX, can adding it to scale_borrow_balance at line 67 or line 70 cause overflow and bypass checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Supply Balance Underreporting] If supply_balance from storage::get_total_supply() at line 61 is underreported, can scale_supply_balance at line 64 be artificially low, failing legitimate borrows at line 67? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Balance Overreporting] If borrow_balance at line 61 is manipulated to be higher, can it cause the borrow check at line 67 to fail incorrectly, DoS-ing borrows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Index Manipulation Attack] Can an attacker manipulate current_supply_index or current_borrow_index at line 62 to pass ray_mul at lines 64-65 with incorrect scaled values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Strict Less Than] Line 67 uses strict < comparison - if scale_borrow_balance + amount == scale_supply_balance, borrow fails. Is this too restrictive and can it be exploited to DoS borrows? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Ray Mul Overflow] Can ray_math::ray_mul at lines 64-65 overflow if supply_balance or borrow_balance and respective indices are extremely large? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Ratio Overflow] Can (scale_borrow_balance + amount) at line 70 numerator overflow before ray_div is calculated, producing wrong current_borrow_ratio? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Ray Div Precision Loss] Does ray_math::ray_div at line 70 lose precision allowing current_borrow_ratio to appear lower than actual, bypassing the cap at line 73? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Ratio Cap Race] Between calculating current_borrow_ratio at line 70 and checking against borrow_ratio cap at line 73, can the cap be lowered causing legitimate borrows to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Cap Ceiling Bypass] If borrow_ratio from storage::get_borrow_cap_ceiling_ratio() at line 72 is set to u256::MAX or very high value, can unlimited borrowing occur passing check at line 73?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Borrow Ratio Equals Cap] If borrow_ratio exactly equals current_borrow_ratio, the >= check at line 73 passes - is there sufficient buffer or can this lead to exactly maxing out the pool? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Ratio Cap Zero] If borrow_ratio cap at line 72 is zero, will line 73 block all borrows even when supply exists? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Redundant Checks] Lines 67 and 73 both limit borrowing - can an attacker exploit the difference between absolute balance check and ratio check to borrow more than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_borrow()] [Check Ordering] If line 67 passes but line 73 fails, or vice versa, does this indicate incorrect cap configuration that can be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [Type Check Only] Line 77 only validates coin type - can an attacker repay with wrong CoinType that matches string representation but has different value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [Zero Repayment] Line 78 blocks zero repayment, but can amount=1 minimal repayments be used to manipulate debt tracking or interest calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [No Borrow Balance Check] validate_repay doesn't verify that repayment amount <= actual borrow balance - can over-repayment occur and corrupt accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [No Debt Verification] validate_repay doesn't check if the repayer has any outstanding debt - can arbitrary addresses repay debts they don't owe? (Medium)"
