  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Nested Calls] If split_coin() is called recursively or within nested vault operations, does tx_context::sender() remain stable, or can context switching redirect remainders incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Call Chain] Since split_coin_to_balance() calls split_coin() on line 30, does this create a vulnerability where the remainder is transferred mid-operation before the Balance conversion completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Vault Deposit] When vault deposit logic calls split_coin() to extract fee amounts, does the remainder transfer on line 24 bypass vault custody, allowing users to retain funds that should be locked in deposit buffers? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Withdrawal Processing] If split_coin() is used during vault withdrawals to split fees from user proceeds, can an attacker exploit the remainder transfer to receive more than their entitled withdrawal amount? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Fee Collection] When vault fee_config logic uses split_coin() to extract protocol fees, does the automatic remainder transfer interfere with fee accounting or allow fee bypass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Request Buffer] If deposit/withdrawal request buffers call split_coin() to partition coins, does the remainder transfer create inconsistency between buffer state and actual coin custody? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Share Minting] If vault share minting logic uses split_coin_to_balance() to convert deposit coins, does the intermediate remainder transfer (from split_coin call) cause shares to be minted for incorrect amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Asset Return] When vault operations use split_coin_to_balance() to return borrowed assets to external protocols, does the remainder transfer break the adaptor's asset tracking and cause custody imbalances? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Operator Actions] If vault operators call split_coin() during 'during_operation' status to split protocol assets, does the public nature of the function allow bypassing operator freeze restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Locking Windows] Can split_coin() be exploited during withdrawal locking windows to extract coins early by splitting requested amounts and transferring remainders to bypass time locks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Error Code] If UTILS_AMOUNT_ZERO (46000) or UTILS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS (46001) errors are thrown, can vault error handling logic confuse these with vault-specific error codes, causing incorrect failure recovery? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Assertion Failure] If assertion on line 13 fails with amount = 0, does this abort the entire transaction including any prior vault state changes, potentially causing DoS if exploited in critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Insufficient Funds] If assertion on line 14 fails due to coin_value < amount, can an attacker deliberately trigger this to DoS vault deposits or withdrawals by providing under-funded coins? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Panic Handling] Do vault modules properly handle assertion failures from split_coin(), or can unhandled panics leave vault in inconsistent state with partial operations completed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Type Parameter] Can attacker supply a malicious CoinType that implements coin-like interface but has custom logic in split/value methods to bypass amount checks or manipulate balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Type Confusion] If vault code calls split_coin with wrong generic type parameter, does type mismatch cause silent failures or can it be exploited to extract wrong asset types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Generic Mismatch] Can split_coin_to_balance be called with CoinType that doesn't match expected vault asset types, causing type confusion when Balance is used in vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Type Invariant] Does split_coin maintain type safety guarantees when used across vault modules, or can cross-module calls violate type invariants through generic parameter manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Rounding Error] If amount is calculated from percentage-based fee splits with rounding, can repeated split_coin() calls compound rounding errors to cause significant fund loss or gain? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Dust Accumulation] Can strategic calls to split_coin() with specific amounts leave dust remainders that accumulate in user accounts instead of vault, draining protocol value over time? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Value Precision] When splitting coins with large values (near u64::MAX), can precision loss in amount calculations cause split_coin() to transfer incorrect remainder amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Gas Griefing] Can attacker repeatedly call split_coin() with amount = 1 to create many small remainder transfers, griefing vault gas costs and making operations uneconomical? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [DoS Vector] If split_coin() is called in a loop during vault operations, can assertion failures on line 13 or 14 be triggered to DoS the entire operation by providing invalid amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin()] [Transfer DoS] Can the public_transfer on line 24 fail if recipient address is invalid or blocked, causing entire vault operation to revert and creating DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/utils/sources/utils.move] [Function: split_coin_to_balance()] [Nested DoS] Since split_coin_to_balance calls split_coin, can attacker trigger DoS by causing split_coin to fail, which then fails balance conversion and blocks vault deposits? (Medium)"
