  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Comment Accuracy] Comments at lines 35-41 document E27 decimal base for HF, but this is not enforced in code. Can incorrect assumptions lead to misinterpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Decimal Mismatch] If min_health_factor is provided in E9 base instead of E27, the comparison at line 33 would be incorrect. Can caller confusion cause security issues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Edge Case: HF = 0] If health_factor is 0 (maximally unhealthy), hf_normalized becomes 0. Can the error code 0 conflict with 'success' codes in other parts of the system? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Edge Case: HF = 1] If health_factor is exactly 1.0e27 (critical threshold), hf_normalized becomes 1e9. Can positions at exactly HF=1.0 pass if min_health_factor is also 1e27? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Edge Case: HF = u256::MAX] If lending_core returns u256::MAX as an error signal, hf_normalized caps at 1e9. Can this cause the function to incorrectly treat errors as extremely healthy positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Edge Case: Equal Values] For health_factor == min_health_factor, the function returns false. Is this the intended behavior, and can it cause positions at exact thresholds to be unnecessarily rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Edge Case: Very Small HF] For health_factor in range (0, DECIMAL_E18), hf_normalized becomes 0. Can this cause loss of information about how unhealthy a position is? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Return Value] Returns boolean directly from comparison. Can the lack of intermediate checks allow incorrect boolean logic in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [No Side Effects] The function is view-like but takes &mut Storage. Can unintended side effects occur even though it returns a boolean? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Unused Boolean] The is_healthy boolean at line 33 is computed but only used implicitly in assert. Can this variable be eliminated, or does it serve an optimization purpose? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can an attacker flash borrow assets, deposit to Navi to boost health factor, pass this check, execute vault operation with boosted leverage, then repay flash loan? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Flash Collateral] Can an attacker flash deposit collateral to Navi, pass health check, borrow maximum from vault, then immediately remove collateral and default? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Flash Manipulation] Can the boolean check be gamed with flash loans to show false health status that enables risky vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Oracle Price Lag] Can an attacker exploit delays between oracle price updates and health checks to borrow at old favorable prices before oracle catches up? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Oracle Sandwich] Can an attacker sandwich oracle price updates to manipulate health factor: update price up, pass check, update price down, profit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Multi-Oracle Attack] If multiple oracles are involved (collateral vs debt), can an attacker manipulate the ratio between them to inflate health factor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Reentrancy via Storage] Since Storage is &mut, can a callback during logic::user_health_factor re-enter this function or other vault functions to corrupt state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Cross-Function Reentrancy] Can an attacker call is_navi_position_healthy() from within a callback during verify_navi_position_healthy(), causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [MEV Extraction] Can MEV bots monitor NaviHealthFactorVerified events to front-run vault rebalancing operations with their own positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Liquidation Front-Running] Can bots use this function to check health status of many accounts and front-run liquidations for profit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Sniping Opportunities] Can attackers query health status to identify accounts near liquidation threshold and snipe profitable liquidations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Griefing Attack] Can an attacker intentionally let their position become unhealthy to prevent vault operations that depend on their health check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Spam Griefing] Can an attacker spam calls to this function with various account addresses to waste gas and slow down legitimate vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Query Griefing] Can the lack of rate limiting allow attackers to spam health status queries to overload the oracle or lending_core modules? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Collateral Swap] Can an attacker swap collateral types in Navi between low-LTV and high-LTV assets to pass health checks with less actual collateral value? (High)"
