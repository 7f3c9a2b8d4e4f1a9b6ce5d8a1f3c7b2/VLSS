  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Partial Pause] Can stake operations be paused while unstake remains active, or is pause always global to all operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Missing Fields] Should Manage track additional state like pause_timestamp or pause_reason for audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Overflow Safety] Does Sui Move prevent u64 overflow in version comparisons, or can version arithmetic cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Type Safety] Is VERSION typed as u64 consistently throughout codebase, preventing type coercion vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Ownership] Since Manage has only 'store' ability, who owns Manage instances, and can ownership transfer cause state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Lifetime] What is the expected lifetime of Manage instances, and are there cleanup mechanisms when pools are deprecated? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Drop Ability] Should Manage have 'drop' ability to enable safe cleanup, or would this introduce security risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Memory Consistency] In concurrent execution, can set_paused() writes be reordered relative to check_not_paused() reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Memory Consistency] Can migrate_version() writes be reordered relative to check_version() reads in concurrent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Package Visibility] [Key Management] If package visibility is used instead of AdminCap for set_paused()/migrate_version(), what prevents compromised package modules from abuse? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Privilege Escalation] Can operator-level accounts abuse package visibility to call set_paused() without AdminCap? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Event Ordering] If events are emitted in parent modules after set_paused(), can event order be manipulated to hide pause state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Event Ordering] If migration events are emitted after version change, can failures between version update and event emission cause audit gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Imports] [Dependency Safety] Does manage.move have minimal dependencies, and can upstream dependency changes break version or pause logic? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Exports] [Export Safety] What modules import manage.move, and can malicious importing modules abuse exported functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Default Pause] Why is paused=true the default in new(), and can this cause availability issues during deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Default Version] Is VERSION=2 indicating prior version 1 exists, and are migration paths from v1 to v2 properly tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Level] [Documentation] Does lack of inline comments hide security-critical assumptions about version/pause behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Documentation] Is the <= check in migrate_version() documented to explain why equality is allowed, preventing future bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Capability Pattern] Should set_paused() take a capability parameter directly instead of relying on parent module authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Capability Pattern] Should migrate_version() take a capability parameter directly instead of relying on parent module authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Version Skip] Can migrate_version() skip versions (e.g., v1 -> v3), and does this cause missing migration logic to be skipped? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Version Requirement] Does check_version() ensure exact version match, preventing forward deployment of v3 code with v2 data? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Transaction Ordering] Can mempool transaction ordering be exploited to front-run set_paused(true) with malicious operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Transaction Ordering] Can migrate_version() be front-run with operations that would fail after migration? (Low)"
