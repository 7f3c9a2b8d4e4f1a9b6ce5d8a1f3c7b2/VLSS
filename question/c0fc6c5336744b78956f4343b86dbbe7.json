  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Concurrent Updates] Can multiple concurrent calls to update_momentum_position_value for different assets race and corrupt vault state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Update Ordering] Does the order of updating different Momentum positions matter for total vault valuation, and can attackers exploit update ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Price Staleness Window] How long can oracle prices be stale before they're rejected, and can attackers exploit this window for advantageous value updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: All Functions] [Block Timestamp Dependencies] Are there timing assumptions in the code that break with irregular block times or timestamp manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Double Counting] Can the same position be registered under multiple asset_type keys, allowing double-counting in vault total value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Value Unit Consistency] Are value_a + value_b in consistent units (USD with specific decimals), and does vault expect this format? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Stale Value Persistence] If an update fails after calculating usd_value but before storing it, does old stale value persist, and can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Pool State Consistency] Does MomentumPool guarantee that sqrt_price and tick data are consistent, or can they be in inconsistent states during updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Pool Pause] If the Momentum pool is paused/frozen, does this function still return valid amounts or should it revert? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: All Functions] [Pool Upgrade] If MomentumPool is upgraded with new sqrt_price calculation, will this adaptor remain compatible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Pool Flash Crash] Can a flash crash in the pool (temporary extreme price) pass slippage checks if oracle hasn't updated, allowing value manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Position Modification] If the position is modified (add/remove liquidity) during value calculation, can this cause inconsistent amount readings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Position Deletion] If a position is deleted from vault's defi_assets between get and finish_update, does this cause errors or corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: All Functions] [Position Borrowing] If the position is borrowed for operations while value is being updated, can this cause race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: sqrt_price_x64_to_price()] [Equal Decimals] When decimals_a == decimals_b, the function returns price_u256_with_decimals directly - is this correct or should there still be adjustments? (Medium)",
