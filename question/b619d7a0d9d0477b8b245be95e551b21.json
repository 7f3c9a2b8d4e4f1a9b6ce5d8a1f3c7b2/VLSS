  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Critical Stub Risk] All functions currently abort(0) - if Volo Vault adaptors (Cetus/Momentum) call add_delta() during vault operations, will this cause complete DoS of withdraw/deposit operations when processing CLMM positions, leading to fund lockup? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Critical Stub Risk] Since get_amount_x_for_liquidity() aborts, can an attacker trigger vault operations that depend on this function to calculate token amounts for Cetus positions, causing operation failure and preventing other users from withdrawing while the operation is stuck? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_y_for_liquidity()] [Critical Stub Risk] If get_amount_y_for_liquidity() is called during a vault operation's position valuation, will the abort cause the entire operation to fail, potentially trapping borrowed assets in external protocols (Cetus) without ability to complete return? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amounts_for_liquidity()] [Critical Stub Risk] When vault's Cetus adaptor attempts to calculate both token amounts for a position using get_amounts_for_liquidity(), will the abort prevent proper asset accounting, allowing operators to leave positions open indefinitely and bypass loss_tolerance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_liquidity_for_amount_x()] [Critical Stub Risk] If vault attempts to determine liquidity from token X amount via get_liquidity_for_amount_x() during deposit request processing, will the abort cause request buffer corruption where shares are minted but liquidity is never provided? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_liquidity_for_amount_y()] [Integration DoS] Can an attacker deposit assets that force the vault to call get_liquidity_for_amount_y() during operation, knowing it will abort and lock the vault in 'during_operation' status indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_liquidity_for_amounts()] [Critical Stub Risk] When the stub get_liquidity_for_amounts() is replaced with real implementation, will the vault have validation to ensure the function cannot return liquidity=0 for non-zero amounts, preventing zero-share minting attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: check_is_fix_coin_a()] [Critical Stub Risk] If check_is_fix_coin_a() aborts during vault's determination of which token to use for slippage protection, can this cause vault to accept unbounded slippage on Cetus position entries, leading to sandwich attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Module: mmt_v3::liquidity_math] [Version Control Risk] When this stub module is replaced with the actual implementation, will there be validation that the new code maintains API compatibility, or could breaking changes cause vault operations to silently fail with different abort codes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Module: mmt_v3::liquidity_math] [Dependency Risk] Since this is a local_dependencies copy of MMT v3 code, if the upstream MMT v3 has critical bugs in these functions, will Volo's integration testing catch discrepancies before deployment? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Signed Integer Overflow] When add_delta() is implemented with I128 delta_liquidity, can an attacker pass I128::max() causing (current_liquidity + delta) to overflow u128::max, wrapping to a small liquidity value and allowing theft of position value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Signed Integer Underflow] If delta_liquidity is I128::min() (large negative), will add_delta() allow current_liquidity to underflow below zero, either aborting (DoS) or wrapping to u128::max (catastrophic accounting)? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the I128 to u128 conversion in add_delta() by passing a negative delta that, when cast, produces a large positive u128, inflating liquidity and minting excess shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Underflow DoS] If current_liquidity is 100 and delta_liquidity is -200, will add_delta() properly abort with a meaningful error, or could it cause a generic abort that prevents legitimate liquidity removal operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Zero Liquidity Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly call operations that use add_delta() with negative deltas to drain liquidity to exactly zero, then prevent all future operations because liquidity=0 fails downstream checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [I128 Precision Loss] When converting between I128 and u128 in add_delta(), could precision loss in the signed representation cause liquidity to be off by 1, enabling repeated rounding attacks to extract value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Negative Delta Validation] Will add_delta() implementation validate that negative deltas are only applied when sufficient liquidity exists, or could vault operations apply deltas without checking current_liquidity first? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: add_delta()] [Delta Sign Manipulation] Can an attacker control the sign of delta_liquidity by manipulating upstream calculations (price changes, swap amounts) to force unexpected liquidity increases/decreases? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Rounding Manipulation] When round_up=false, can an attacker repeatedly call operations using get_amount_x_for_liquidity() to extract value through rounding down, withdrawing slightly more token X than they should? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Rounding Direction Error] If the implementation incorrectly rounds down when round_up=true or vice versa, can vault users systematically extract value by depositing/withdrawing with manipulated rounding? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [u128 to u64 Overflow] Since return type is u64 but inputs are u128, if (liquidity * sqrt_price_delta) exceeds u64::max, will the implementation silently truncate or abort, and can this be exploited for DoS or value extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Sqrt Price Inversion] If sqrt_price_current < sqrt_price_target (inverted), will get_amount_x_for_liquidity() return a negative result cast to u64 (huge value) or abort, and can this be triggered by manipulated oracle prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Zero Liquidity Edge Case] When liquidity=0, will get_amount_x_for_liquidity() return 0 or abort, and can an attacker use zero-liquidity positions to bypass vault accounting checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [Price Range Boundary] If sqrt_price_current equals sqrt_price_target, will get_amount_x_for_liquidity() return 0 without division by zero, or could edge case handling cause unexpected aborts during vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/liquidity_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_for_liquidity()] [MAX u128 Price] Can an attacker manipulate sqrt prices to u128::max causing get_amount_x_for_liquidity() multiplication to overflow, either aborting (DoS) or wrapping to produce incorrect small amounts? (High)"
