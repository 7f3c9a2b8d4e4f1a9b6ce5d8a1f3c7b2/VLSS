  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Collateral Value] Can collateral valuation differ between version 13 and 14, and does pre_check_version() prevent users from having positions valued under mixed version rules? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Reward Claiming] When users claim incentive rewards, does pre_check_version() ensure Incentive v2/v3 version matches Storage version to prevent reward manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Reward Rate] If reward emission rates change between versions, does this_version() determine active rate, and can attackers stake just before version upgrade to maximize rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Boosted Balance] Can volo liquid staking boosted balances be calculated using wrong version formula if pre_check_version() is bypassed, inflating or deflating user rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Pause Override] Does pre_check_version() execute even when protocol is paused, and can this cause version checks to fail during emergency pause, preventing admin recovery? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Emergency Upgrade] During emergency upgrade requiring immediate version change, does this_version() support hot-patching constants::version() without full module upgrade? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Recovery Path] If pre_check_version() prevents all operations due to version mismatch, is there recovery path that bypasses version checks for admin to fix the situation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Type Confusion] Can v parameter be constructed from non-version u64 values (like timestamps or amounts), and would pre_check_version() incorrectly validate these as versions? (Low)"
