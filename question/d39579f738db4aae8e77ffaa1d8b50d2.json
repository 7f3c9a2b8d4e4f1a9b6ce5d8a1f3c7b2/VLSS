  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [State Management] [Parent-Child Tracking] No tracking of parent-child relationships - if parent is deleted, how does protocol find and handle orphaned children? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [State Management] [Lifecycle Events] No events emitted on cap creation/deletion - can lack of observability hide malicious cap operations from monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Vault Integration] [AccountCap in Vault] Since AccountCap has 'store', can it be deposited into volo-vault as an asset? If so, what happens to lending positions when cap is locked in vault during operation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Vault Integration] [Borrowed AccountCap] Can volo-vault adaptors borrow AccountCaps from Navi positions? If so, can attacker use borrowed cap to access lending positions they don't own? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Vault Integration] [Health Factor] If AccountCap is used as collateral, how is health factor calculated? Could deletion of cap while borrowed cause liquidation cascade? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Vault Integration] [Receipt Matching] If vault issues receipts for deposited AccountCaps, can receipt-cap mismatch allow withdrawal of wrong cap, enabling theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Vault Integration] [Operation Lock] During vault operations, if AccountCap is locked, can lending operations still proceed? Could this bypass vault's operation status gating? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Type Safety] [Generic Type Parameters] Module has no generics - could lack of type parameterization allow AccountCaps from different lending protocols to be confused? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Type Safety] [Capability Pattern] AccountCap is simple struct without phantom types - can this lead to capability confusion where wrong cap is used for wrong operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Type Safety] [Address Type] Owner stored as raw address - no wrapped type for type safety. Can raw address be misused or confused with other address types? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Reentrancy] [Creation During Deletion] If create_account_cap and delete_account_cap are called in same transaction, can reentrancy cause cap to be deleted mid-creation breaking invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Reentrancy] [Child Creation Loop] Can an attacker create child cap, use it to create grandchild, loop back to modify parent in same transaction causing state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Race Condition] [Concurrent Operations] If multiple transactions operate on same AccountCap simultaneously, can race conditions cause double-spend or position corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Race Condition] [Transfer Race] If AccountCap is transferred while lending operation is in progress, does operation complete with old owner or fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Error Handling] [Error Module Dependency] Uses lending_core::error module - if error module is compromised to return success for failures, can all assertions be bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Error Handling] [Single Error Type] Only uses required_parent_account_cap() error - are there other error conditions that should be checked but aren't? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Error Handling] [No Custom Errors] Module doesn't define own errors - could this cause ambiguous error messages hiding exploit attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [Cap Theft] AccountCap has 'store' so can be transferred - if attacker steals cap via phishing or social engineering, can they drain all lending positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [Cap Wrapping] Attacker wraps victim's AccountCap in malicious object - can they block victim's access while maintaining their own access to positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [Sybil Attack] Create unlimited AccountCaps with different UIDs but same owner - can this bypass per-user limits in lending protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [Child Cap Spam] Create thousands of child caps to bloat state - can this cause DoS for operations that iterate over user's caps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [Deletion Griefing] Delete victim's AccountCap while they have active positions - can this lock their funds permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Attack Vector] [UID Prediction] If UIDs are predictable, can attacker create AccountCap with same UID as victim to hijack their positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Missing Validation] [No Cap Limit] No limit on caps per user - can attacker create unlimited caps causing storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Missing Validation] [No Owner Validation] Owner address never validated as non-zero or valid - can caps have invalid owners? (High)"
