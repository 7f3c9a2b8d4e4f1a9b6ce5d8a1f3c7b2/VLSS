  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Underpricing] Can an attacker set fee to 0, creating a free oracle queue that drains oracle resources without compensation, causing economic DoS as oracles refuse to serve free requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Overpricing] Can an attacker set fee to u64::MAX, creating a queue with impossibly high costs that prevents any user from making oracle requests, causing service DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Manipulation] Can an attacker set fee_recipient to their own address while using a legitimate-looking authority address, siphoning oracle fees meant for the protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Zero Address] Can an attacker set fee_recipient to @0x0, causing oracle fees to be burned or stuck, breaking fee distribution to oracles and creating economic disincentive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Mismatch with Guardian] If the new queue's fee is 1000x higher than guardian_queue's fee, can this create economic inconsistency where child queue price-gates access differently than parent? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Collision] Can an attacker create a queue with name='Official Switchboard Queue' to impersonate the legitimate protocol queue, confusing users checking queue names? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Length Attack] Can an attacker pass a 100MB String as name parameter, causing excessive storage costs and potential DoS when the name is read or displayed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Special Characters] Can an attacker inject null bytes or control characters in the name String to break UI display or cause parsing errors in off-chain indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Unicode Exploit] Can an attacker use Unicode homoglyphs in the name (e.g., Cyrillic 'a' instead of Latin 'a') to create phishing queues that appear identical to legitimate ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Stale Reference] Can an attacker pass a reference to a guardian_queue that was valid at transaction start but gets deleted/modified before actuate() executes, causing inconsistent guardian_queue_id storage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Queue ID Mismatch] Since actuate() stores guardian_queue.id() at line 91, can attacker exploit timing between validate() and actuate() if guardian queue ID changes, storing mismatched guardian reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Malicious State] Can an attacker control the guardian_queue reference to point to their own malicious queue with version=1 but corrupted existing_oracles table, bypassing guardian verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Queue Self-Reference] Can an attacker create a queue that references itself as guardian_queue_id (passing its own ID), creating circular dependency that breaks guardian override logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Permission] Since validate() takes immutable &Queue reference, can attacker pass a guardian_queue they don't own, creating queues that claim to be governed by guardian queues they can't control? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Timing Attack] Can an attacker observe the OracleQueueCreated event emission at line 62 and frontrun queue configuration changes before the queue is actually usable, griefing legitimate users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Leakage] Does emitting queue_key in OracleQueueCreated event at line 60 expose sensitive queue identifier data that could be used for targeted attacks on the queue? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] Can an attacker listen for OracleQueueCreated events and replay the parameters to create duplicate queues with same configuration but different IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Missing Validation] Since event is emitted after queue::new() but without checking the returned queue_id is valid, can corrupted queue creation still emit success events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Creation Failure] If queue::new() at line 43 fails silently or returns a default ID, can the function complete and emit event with invalid queue_id, creating ghost queue references? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Shared Object Timing] Since queue::new() calls transfer::share_object(), can attacker create race conditions by immediately calling queue modification functions before the share operation completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Parameter Passthrough] Does actuate() blindly pass all parameters to queue::new() without additional validation, allowing queue::new() vulnerabilities to propagate through this entry point? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue is_guardian_queue Flag] Since actuate() hardcodes is_guardian_queue=false at line 52, can attacker never create guardian queues through this entry point, requiring different initialization path that might have different security properties?

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation TOCTOU] Between validate() check at line 78 and actuate() execution at line 83, can guardian_queue state be modified by another transaction, invalidating validation assumptions?
