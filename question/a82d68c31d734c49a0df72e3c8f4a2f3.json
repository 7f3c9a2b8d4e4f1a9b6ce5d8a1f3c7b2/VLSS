  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Arithmetic Overflow] Can add() overflow when summing two large Decimal values (each near u256::MAX), causing wrap-around where total_value < individual_values, breaking vault TVL calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [No Saturation] Does add() abort on overflow rather than saturating, allowing attackers to DoS vault operations by forcing overflows during deposit aggregation or reward accumulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Cumulative Error] When adding multiple small Decimals in sequence (e.g., per-epoch rewards), can accumulated rounding errors cause total to diverge from expected sum, enabling theft through precision manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Commutativity] Is add() commutative and associative given u256 arithmetic, or can different orderings of additions yield different results due to overflow behavior, causing non-deterministic vault states?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Arithmetic Underflow] Can sub(a, b) underflow when b > a, causing abort and DoS of withdrawal operations, or does it wrap to a huge value enabling inflation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [No Validation] Does sub() lack pre-check that a >= b, allowing negative balance calculations to wrap to large positive values, breaking accounting invariants in vault balance tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Sign Representation] Since Decimal lacks sign bit, can negative results from sub() wrap around, causing logical errors where debt is represented as large positive values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [DoS Vector] If vault fee calculation uses sub(total_amount, fee_amount) and fee > total due to misconfiguration, does abort in sub() brick all withdrawals until admin intervention? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: saturating_sub()] [Silent Underflow] Does saturating_sub() return 0 when a < b without emitting events, allowing silent loss of precision in reward calculations where users lose entitled rewards? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: saturating_sub()] [Incorrect Usage] If developers use saturating_sub() where sub() abort is desired to catch errors, can this hide critical bugs where calculations go negative, enabling gradual fund drainage?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: saturating_sub()] [Comparison Logic] Does the comparison a.value < b.value correctly handle edge case where a == b, returning 0 instead of error, and is this intended behavior for all use cases? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: mul()] [Precision Loss] Does mul() lose precision when (a.value * b.value) < WAD, causing the result to round to zero and enabling attackers to drain funds through repeated small multiplications? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: mul()] [Order of Operations] Does mul() perform multiplication before division, and can attackers exploit this to cause overflow in intermediate calculation even when final result would fit in u256? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: mul()] [Rounding Direction] Does integer division by WAD always round down, systematically biasing all multiplications toward lower values and enabling gradual value extraction through repeated operations?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Function: mul()] [Commutativity] Is mul() commutative (mul(a,b) == mul(b,a)) given potential overflow differences, or can order-dependent overflow cause non-deterministic results in vault calculations? (Medium)",
