  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: liquidation()] [Authorization] Does liquidation() properly sequence incentive updates before the actual liquidation, or could reordering allow reward manipulation during liquidation events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Module: lending_core::incentive_v3] [Friend Declaration] Does the single 'friend lending_core::manage' declaration provide sufficient access control, or could manage module be compromised to gain unauthorized access to all friend functions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Duplicate Prevention] Does the duplicate_config() check in create_pool() prevent creation of pools with identical coin types across different incentive instances, or only within a single instance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Duplicate Prevention] Can an attacker bypass the duplicate check in create_rule() by creating rules for the same option/reward_coin_type pair in different pools, causing confusion in reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: contains_rule()] [Logic Error] Does contains_rule() iterate through all rules correctly, or could rules be added while the function executes causing race conditions or missed duplicates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_mut_rule()] [Access Control] Does get_mut_rule() being internal prevent unauthorized rule modifications, or could it be called indirectly through public functions without proper validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: update_reward_state_by_asset()] [Authorization] Does update_reward_state_by_asset() being public allow anyone to manipulate reward states by calling it repeatedly with different user addresses, causing DoS or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_claimable_rewards()] [View Function Safety] Can get_user_claimable_rewards() being public with mutable storage reference allow read-only DoS attacks if called with many pools/rules causing excessive computation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Shared Object] Does Incentive being a shared object with mutable friend functions create race conditions when multiple transactions modify pools/rules/fees concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Struct: RewardFund] [Shared Object] Can RewardFund being shared allow concurrent deposit/withdraw operations that cause balance inconsistencies or double-spending if not properly synchronized? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_borrow_fee_rate()] [Rate Limit] Does the 10% cap check 'rate <= constants::percentage_benchmark() / 10' prevent all fee manipulation, or could constants be modified to bypass this limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Version Security] Can version_migrate() be called multiple times to roll version numbers forward and backward, potentially bypassing version-dependent security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_borrow_fee()] [Internal Function] Does deposit_borrow_fee() being internal but called from multiple public functions ensure fee collection happens atomically with borrows, or could reentrancy separate them? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rules()] [Internal Function] Does base_claim_reward_by_rules() being internal prevent direct calls, or could it be exploited through crafted public function calls with malicious parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Internal Function] Can base_claim_reward_by_rule() being called in a loop be exploited to claim the same rewards multiple times if state updates aren't atomic? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Arithmetic Overflow] Can ray_div((max_total_supply as u256), (duration_ms as u256)) overflow when max_total_supply is u64::MAX, causing max_rate to wrap around to small value and bypassing rate limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Arithmetic Overflow] Does ray_div((total_supply as u256), (duration_ms as u256)) overflow when total_supply is maximum and duration_ms is 1, setting impossibly high reward rates? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Division by Zero] Can an attacker set duration_ms to 0 causing division by zero in ray_div, or does the check 'if (duration_ms > 0)' prevent this but allow setting rate to 0 which disables rewards unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Division by Zero] Does 'if (duration == 0 || total_balance == 0)' properly handle the case where total_balance becomes 0 after deposits/withdrawals, potentially causing division by zero in '(rule.rate * (duration as u256)) / total_balance'? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Arithmetic Overflow] Can 'rule.rate * (duration as u256)' overflow when rate is maximum and duration is very large (e.g., years in milliseconds), corrupting global index calculations?
