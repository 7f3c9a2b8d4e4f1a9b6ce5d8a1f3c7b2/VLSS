  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Proof-of-Work] If authority should require proof-of-work or proof-of-stake for deletion (to prevent spam), does has_authority() enforce these requirements, or is simple address matching at line 19 insufficient? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Delegate Call Vulnerability] Can an attacker use delegate call patterns to invoke run() with a different ctx.sender() than the actual transaction signer, bypassing has_authority() checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Chain Break] If authority verification depends on a chain of objects (queue -> aggregator -> authority), can an attacker break this chain by deleting intermediate objects to make has_authority() fail incorrectly or pass incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker repeatedly call run() with invalid aggregators (wrong version) to consume gas and emit misleading error events, griefing the system and masking legitimate deletion attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Metadata Mismatch] If aggregator stores authority metadata (name, description) separately from address, can mismatched metadata cause has_authority() to validate incorrectly, allowing wrong entities to delete? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Bypass] Can an attacker upgrade aggregator version from 1 to 2 externally, then call run() which only accepts EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION=1 at line 18, causing validate() to fail but leaving the aggregator in an inconsistent partially-deleted state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Version Hardcoding] Is EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION=1 at line 6 hardcoded without upgrade path, meaning when aggregators upgrade to version 2, all deletion operations break, leaving undeletable zombie aggregators consuming storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade Attack] If aggregator.version() can be downgraded from 2 to 1 through some exploit, can an attacker force old version validation at line 18 to pass for newer aggregators that should use different deletion logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Migration DoS] During a version migration from v1 to v2, can the transition period create a DoS window where neither old nor new deletion actions work, leaving aggregators undeletable and price feeds stuck? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Comparison Weakness] Does the version check at line 18 use strict equality (==) when it should use >= or <=, causing legitimate version 1 aggregators to fail if version field is 0 or has overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Version Type Overflow] Is EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION stored as u8 at line 6, limiting versions to 0-255, but what happens at version 256 overflow—can attackers exploit wrapping to version 0 or 1 to bypass future version checks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch Invariant] If validate() at line 18 rejects version 2+ aggregators, but Volo Vault still references them in OracleConfig, can this create dangling references where vault queries prices from undeletable v2 aggregators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Rollback Vulnerability] Can an attacker exploit version rollback vulnerabilities in the Aggregator module to reset version from 2 back to 1, making previously undeletable aggregators deletable through this action? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Error: EInvalidAggregatorVersion] [Error Handling] Does EInvalidAggregatorVersion at line 11 provide enough context for debugging, or can error message ambiguity (not showing expected vs actual version) hide version-related attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Order] Should version check at line 18 execute before authority check at line 19 for fail-fast optimization, but current order allows attackers to probe version validity even without authority? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Feature Flag] If version 2 aggregators introduce feature flags (pause, freeze), does validate() check these flags, or can v1-only deletion bypass v2 safety mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Version Governance] Is EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION=1 upgradeable through governance, or is it immutable, meaning governance cannot adapt deletion logic as Switchboard protocol evolves? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Array Access] If aggregator.version() internally accesses array indices based on version number, can version 1 cause out-of-bounds access if the array was initialized for version 0 only? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Version Compatibility] Can v1 deletion action at lines 30-36 safely delete aggregators that were upgraded from v0 to v1, or do legacy fields cause actuate() to fail or leak resources? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Spoof Attack] Can an attacker create a fake Aggregator object with version=1 that passes validate() but isn't registered in the official Switchboard system, allowing unauthorized deletion events?

(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Temporal Attack] Can an attacker exploit version check timing: submit run() transaction during version upgrade window where some nodes see version 1 and others see version 2, causing non-deterministic validation? (Medium)",
