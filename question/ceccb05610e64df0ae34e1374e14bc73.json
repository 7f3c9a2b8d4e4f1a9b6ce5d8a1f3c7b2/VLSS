  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Account State] No snapshot of account state is taken. Can the account modify their Navi position mid-transaction to pass health checks then immediately degrade it? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Position Flash] Can an attacker use flash loans to temporarily boost their Navi position health, pass this check, then unwind the position in the same transaction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [State Consistency] The boolean check doesn't lock state. Can position state change between the boolean check and subsequent vault operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Multi-Account] The function checks a single account. Can vault operations involve multiple accounts, and does checking only one account miss systemic risks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Account Collusion] Can multiple accounts controlled by one attacker coordinate to pass individual health checks while creating systemic risk across all accounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Vault Integration] No context about which vault operation triggered the check. Can health checks pass for deposit operations but fail for withdrawal, creating asymmetric risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Operation Atomicity] Health check is separate from vault operation. Can an attacker pass the health check, then have the vault operation fail, leaving inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Integration Gap] The boolean function returns health status but doesn't enforce it. Can calling code ignore the return value and proceed with unsafe operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Pre-Check Timing] If called as a pre-check before vault operations, can the time delay between check and operation allow position degradation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Post-Check Timing] If called as a post-check after vault operations, can the operation itself cause health factor to drop below threshold after passing pre-check? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Liquidation Race] During rapid price movements, can an attacker exploit the lag between health check and liquidation to extract value before being liquidated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Emergency Shutdown] No emergency shutdown mechanism exists. Can the health limiter be bypassed during system-wide emergency states in the vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Liquidation Check] The boolean function could be used in liquidation logic. Can griefing attacks spam this function to prevent legitimate liquidations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Cascading Failures] If multiple positions become unhealthy simultaneously, can sequential health checks cause cascading failures and system-wide DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Gas Griefing] The function calls external lending_core logic with mutable Storage. Can an attacker craft transactions that consume excessive gas during health factor calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [DoS via Revert] An unhealthy position causes the entire transaction to revert. Can an attacker intentionally maintain unhealthy positions to DoS vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Gas Cost] The function queries lending_core for health factor. Can the gas cost be manipulated by adding many small positions to the account? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Event Gas] Event emission at line 27 costs gas. Can an attacker repeatedly trigger health checks to drain gas from legitimate operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Config Management] min_health_factor is passed as parameter without central configuration. Can different callers use different thresholds, creating inconsistent risk profiles? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Threshold Update] No mechanism to update min_health_factor globally. Can outdated thresholds remain in use during market volatility, causing under-collateralization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: is_navi_position_healthy()] [Threshold Consistency] Both functions accept min_health_factor as parameter. Can caller pass different values to the two functions, creating logic inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Conservative Threshold] No guidance on what min_health_factor value should be. Can setting it too low (e.g., 1.0e27) allow risky positions that are technically 'healthy' but near liquidation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Aggressive Threshold] Can setting min_health_factor too high (e.g., 5.0e27) unnecessarily restrict legitimate vault operations and reduce capital efficiency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Constants] [Decimal Clarity] DECIMAL_E18 and DECIMAL_E9 are defined but no comments explain which is Navi's native base. Can developers misuse these constants in caller code? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/health-limiter/sources/adaptors/navi_limiter.move] [Function: verify_navi_position_healthy()] [Decimal Assumption] The code assumes health_factor from Navi uses E27 decimals (based on comments). Can changes in Navi's implementation break this assumption silently? (High)"
