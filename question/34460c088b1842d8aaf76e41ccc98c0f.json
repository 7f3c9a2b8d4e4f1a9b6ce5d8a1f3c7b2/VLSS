  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Rounding Direction] When converting from high decimal to low decimal (e.g., 18 to 6), the division by 10^12 rounds down. Can attackers exploit this systematic rounding to extract value by timing operations when rounding is most favorable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Dust Accumulation] Over many conversions with precision loss, can small rounding errors accumulate to significant amounts? Could attackers repeatedly trigger conversions to amplify these errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Price Manipulation via Decimals] If an attacker can influence the target_decimal parameter in calling contracts, can they choose a target_decimal that maximizes rounding errors in their favor (e.g., choosing target_decimal=1 for maximum truncation)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Timestamp Range] What is the valid range for timestamps returned by Supra oracle? Can timestamps be in the far future or far past, causing staleness checks to malfunction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Timestamp Precision Loss] When timestamp is cast from u128 to u64, if Supra oracle uses high-precision timestamps (e.g., nanoseconds stored in u128), does casting to u64 lose precision that could affect staleness calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Timestamp Zero] If timestamp=0 is returned (indicating invalid/unset timestamp), does the function reject it or allow it to propagate, potentially bypassing all staleness checks in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Timestamp Monotonicity] If Supra oracle returns non-monotonic timestamps (timestamp_new < timestamp_old) due to oracle issues, can this cause vault operations to accept stale prices thinking they are fresh? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Invalid Pair ID] If pair parameter is a non-existent or deprecated pair ID in Supra oracle, does supra::get_price() revert, return zero, or return stale data? Can this be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: pair_id_to_vector()] [Reserved Pair IDs] Are there reserved pair ID values (e.g., 0, u32::MAX) that should not be used? Can converting these to vectors produce special patterns that break storage or routing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: vector_to_pair_id()] [Pair ID Enumeration] Can attackers enumerate valid pair IDs by trying different vector inputs until they find ones that don't revert, potentially discovering unlisted or internal pair feeds? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Public Functions] All functions are marked 'public fun', meaning any module can call them. Are there scenarios where restricting access (e.g., only vault contracts) would improve security by preventing unauthorized price queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [OracleHolder Ownership] Does the function verify that the OracleHolder is owned or controlled by a trusted entity? Can attackers create fake OracleHolder objects and pass them to this function? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Module Upgrades] If this oracle::adaptor_supra module is upgraded, can the upgrade introduce breaking changes that affect existing vault operations? Is there a safe upgrade path? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Price Bounds] Are there any sanity checks on the price value returned (e.g., price > 0, price < max_reasonable_price)? Can extreme prices (near u128::MAX) cause overflow in downstream calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Decimal Bounds] Can decimal values returned be unreasonable (e.g., decimal > 18 for typical tokens, or decimal=0)? Does the lack of validation allow incorrect decimal interpretations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Conversion Correctness] If the utils::to_target_decimal_value_safe() function has bugs (e.g., off-by-one in the loop), can incorrect decimal_price values be returned, causing systemic vault mispricing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Sandwich Attack] Can an attacker sandwich vault operations around oracle price updates, using knowledge of when Supra oracle will update to profit from the price change combined with precision loss in decimal conversion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can an attacker use flash loans to manipulate the underlying assets in Supra oracle's price calculation, then call get_price_native() at the manipulated price, profit in the vault, and repay the flash loan? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Arbitrage via Decimals] Can attackers arbitrage between different vault operations using different target_decimal values, exploiting rounding differences to extract value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Computation DoS] If target_decimal is very different from decimal (e.g., decimal=1, target_decimal=255), can the iterative conversion in to_target_decimal_value_safe() consume excessive gas, DoSing price fetches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: vector_to_pair_id()] [Invalid Input DoS] Can passing extremely large vectors or malformed byte arrays to vector_to_pair_id() cause excessive gas consumption or reverts, DoSing vault operations that rely on pair ID conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Query DoS] If Supra oracle has rate limits or can be DoS'd, can attackers exhaust these limits by repeatedly calling get_price_native(), preventing legitimate vault operations from fetching prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Caller Assumptions] Do calling contracts correctly handle the case where get_price_to_target_decimal() returns (0, timestamp), indicating a failed or zero price? Can callers misinterpret this as a valid price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Error Propagation] If supra::get_price() reverts (e.g., due to invalid pair or oracle offline), does get_price_native() propagate the error correctly, or can it return partial/default values that appear valid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Version Compatibility] If different parts of the vault system use different versions of this adaptor module, can version mismatches cause price inconsistencies or double-counting? (Medium)"
