(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_apy_one()] [Ray Math Underflow] At lines 236-245, if total_incentive_amount_on_usd is very small relative to protocol_total_supply_on_usd, can the ray_div result in underflow or near-zero values that incorrectly show 0% APY? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_apy_one()] [Option Type Missing] At line 212, option is used to conditionally set protocol_total_supply to borrow balance—if the option field from pool info is corrupt or uninitialized, can this cause wrong supply value to be used?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools()] [Factor Manipulation] At line 64, incentive::calculate_user_effective_amount uses factor from pool info—if factor can be set to extreme values (very large or very small), can this artificially inflate or deflate user rewards?
