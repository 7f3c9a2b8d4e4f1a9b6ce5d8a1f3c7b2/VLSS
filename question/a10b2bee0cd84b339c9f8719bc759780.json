  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Upgrade Attack Surface] If the switchboard module is upgraded, could the new version of run() be exploited if it removes AdminCap check or changes guardian_queue_id handling, breaking security assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Completeness] The GuardianQueueIdSet event only includes old and new IDs - should it also include the admin address who made the change for accountability and audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Validation Feedback] Since validate() is empty, there's no event or feedback indicating what validation was performed - how can off-chain systems verify that the guardian_queue_id change was legitimate? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Missing Pre-Change Snapshot] There's no snapshot of State or guardian configuration taken before the change - if something goes wrong, can the system be restored to the exact previous state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Queue Metadata Loss] When guardian_queue_id changes, is metadata about the old queue (number of guardians, active attestations, configuration) preserved for analysis of why the change was needed? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validate-Actuate Gap] The validate() function is called before actuate(), but since it's empty, there's no actual validation - if actuate() makes assumptions about validated state, could this cause logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Consistency] The actuate() function reads state.guardian_queue() then immediately overwrites it - is there any risk of state inconsistency if another transaction modifies State between the read and write? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [AdminCap Underutilization] AdminCap is only checked at entry but not used for any additional verification or rate limiting - could AdminCap have additional metadata (e.g., permissions bitmap, usage counter) to prevent abuse? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] If guardian_queue_id is changed to a malicious queue with colluding guardians, can fake price attestations pass validation, enabling price oracle manipulation attacks on dependent DeFi protocols like Volo Vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Collusion] Can an admin collude with a set of malicious guardians by creating a custom guardian queue and setting guardian_queue_id to it, bypassing the decentralization guarantees of the oracle system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Attestation Threshold Bypass] If the new guardian_queue has lower attestation thresholds or weaker security than the original, can this be exploited to push through invalid oracle updates more easily? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Staking Impact] When guardian_queue_id changes, do guardians who staked in the old queue lose their stake or rewards, creating financial incentive to resist queue changes even when legitimate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Price Feed Continuity] If guardian_queue_id is changed during active price feed updates, will in-flight updates fail validation, causing price feed gaps that could be exploited for arbitrage or liquidation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Health Check Bypass] If Volo Vault's health limiter depends on guardian-attested prices and guardian_queue_id is switched to a malicious queue, can fake low prices bypass health factor checks, enabling unsafe borrows? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Operation DoS] If guardian_queue_id is set to an invalid or deleted queue, will all Volo Vault operations requiring oracle prices (deposits, withdrawals, rebalancing) fail, causing complete vault DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vault Asset Valuation] When guardian_queue_id changes mid-operation, could Volo Vault's total_usd_value calculations use prices from two different guardian queues, causing accounting inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Protocol Risks] If Volo Vault adaptors (Navi, Cetus, Suilend) use guardian-attested prices for health checks and guardian_queue_id is compromised, can this enable exploitation of external DeFi protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Testing Coverage] The empty validate() function suggests incomplete implementation - are there test cases that verify guardian_queue_id validation will be properly implemented before mainnet deployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Error Handling] There's no error handling or custom error types - if guardian_queue_id changes fail for any reason, will users and off-chain systems receive meaningful error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Invariant Checks] There are no assert! statements or invariant checks - should there be post-execution validation that State.guardian_queue actually equals the intended guardian_queue_id? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running Risk] Can an attacker observe a pending guardian_queue_id change transaction in the mempool and front-run it with oracle price manipulation before the new guardian queue becomes active? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Sandwich Attack] Could an attacker sandwich the guardian_queue_id change transaction with oracle price updates, exploiting the transition period when guardian validation might be inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [MEV Extraction] Can MEV bots detect guardian_queue_id changes and extract value by exploiting price discrepancies between old and new guardian queues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Object Ownership] If the guardian Queue object is not properly owned by the protocol, can its owner modify Queue parameters after guardian_queue_id is set, bypassing intended oracle security? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Recursive Queue Reference] Can guardian_queue_id be set such that the Queue object itself contains a reference back to State, creating circular dependencies that could cause infinite loops in queue traversal? (Low)"
