  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Struct: AccountCap] [Authorization Bypass] The AccountCap has 'store' ability allowing it to be wrapped in other objects or stored in dynamic fields - can an attacker wrap AccountCap in a malicious object to bypass lending_core::lending friend module restrictions and execute unauthorized lending operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Struct: AccountCap] [Ownership Manipulation] AccountCap has 'store' ability enabling transfer via sui::transfer::public_transfer - can an attacker transfer stolen AccountCap to their address and execute lending operations as the original owner, bypassing all ownership checks in lending module? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Struct: AccountCap] [Asset Custody] AccountCap with 'store' can be placed in a Table/Bag and locked - if an attacker deposits user's AccountCap into a malicious contract's storage, can they permanently lock user's lending positions and prevent withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Struct: AccountCap] [DoS Attack] Since AccountCap has 'store', can an attacker create thousands of AccountCaps and store them in a single object to bloat state and cause DoS for lending protocol operations that iterate over account relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Struct: AccountCap] [Privilege Escalation] The 'owner' field is immutable after creation - if an attacker wraps AccountCap in a shared object with 'store', can they create a scenario where multiple addresses claim ownership of the same lending account? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Address Derivation] Function derives owner from object::uid_to_address(&id) - can an attacker predict or manipulate the UID generation to create AccountCap with a pre-determined owner address, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Collision Attack] Owner is set to object::uid_to_address(&id) - is there any guarantee of uniqueness? Could two AccountCaps have the same owner address if UID derivation has collisions, allowing one user to control another's lending account? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Friend Module Bypass] Function is public(friend) restricted to lending_core::lending - if lending module has a vulnerability allowing arbitrary create_account_cap calls, can an attacker mint unlimited AccountCaps to bypass lending limits or create Sybil accounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Resource Exhaustion] No limit on number of AccountCaps per user - can an attacker call lending operations repeatedly to create thousands of AccountCaps, exhausting storage and causing DoS for legitimate users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Initialization Validation] No validation of ctx or initial state - can an attacker pass malformed TxContext to create AccountCap with corrupted owner field, bypassing all ownership checks in lending operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Ownership Mismatch] Owner is derived from UID after creation - could there be a timing window where UID is created but owner derivation fails, resulting in AccountCap with zero/null owner that bypasses all authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_account_cap()] [Cross-Module Attack] Since only lending_core::lending can call this, if lending module doesn't properly track created caps, can an attacker create orphaned AccountCaps that exist but aren't associated with any lending position? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Parent Verification Bypass] Assertion checks object::uid_to_address(&parent_account_cap.id) == owner - can an attacker craft a parent AccountCap where UID address doesn't match owner field to bypass this check and create unauthorized child caps? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Ownership Inheritance] Child cap inherits parent's owner without independent verification - if parent AccountCap was compromised or owner field was manipulated, does child cap inherit the compromised ownership enabling cascading unauthorized access? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Child Cap Proliferation] No limit on number of child caps per parent - can an attacker create unlimited child caps from one parent to bypass per-account lending limits or create Sybil attack vectors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Orphaned Children] If parent AccountCap is deleted but children exist, are child caps orphaned with no parent? Can orphaned child caps still perform lending operations without any parent oversight? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Circular Reference] Can an attacker create a chain where child cap is used to create another child, building a deep tree? Could this cause stack overflow or DoS when lending module traverses parent-child relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Parent Cap Immutability] Function takes immutable reference &parent_account_cap - if parent cap is in use for a lending operation, can an attacker simultaneously create child caps to bypass single-operation restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Assertion Error Handling] Uses error::required_parent_account_cap() for assertion - if error module is compromised or returns incorrect codes, could assertion be bypassed allowing creation of child caps from non-parent AccountCaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Owner Address Reuse] All child caps share same owner as parent - in lending module, can an attacker exploit this to make multiple positions appear as single owner, bypassing per-user collateral or borrow limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [UID Uniqueness] Each child gets new UID but same owner - are UIDs guaranteed unique? Could two child caps have same UID causing lending position collision or double-spend of collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: create_child_account_cap()] [Storage Ability Exploitation] Since AccountCap has 'store', can attacker create child cap, immediately transfer parent to another address, then use orphaned child cap to drain parent's lending positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: delete_account_cap()] [Position Cleanup] Function deletes AccountCap by consuming it but doesn't verify lending positions are closed - can an attacker delete AccountCap while active lending positions exist, making collateral irrecoverable and breaking protocol accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: delete_account_cap()] [Child Cap Orphaning] If parent cap is deleted but children exist, are child caps orphaned but still functional? Can orphaned child caps still access parent's lending positions after parent deletion? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Function: delete_account_cap()] [Outstanding Debt] No check for outstanding borrows or supplied assets - can an attacker delete AccountCap with active debt to avoid liquidation and cause protocol bad debt? (Critical)"
