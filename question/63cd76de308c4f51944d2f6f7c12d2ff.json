[
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Table Growth] Table can grow indefinitely - can an attacker add thousands of aggregators to DoS via storage costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Table Remove Race] If multiple removes execute concurrently, can this corrupt the table? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: OracleConfig] [Table Access Pattern] Direct indexing with aggregators[asset_type] can panic - should all access use contains() check first? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: coin_decimals()] [Panic Risk] Direct table access without existence check - will this panic for invalid asset_type? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: check_version()] [Version Mismatch DoS] If VERSION constant is updated but config.version isn't, all operations fail - can this cause permanent DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Upgrade Ordering] If multiple configs exist, can they be upgraded in wrong order, causing version inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Version Bump Impact] When VERSION changes from 2 to 3, what data migrations are needed? Are they handled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Partial Upgrade] If upgrade fails midway, is the version field rolled back or left in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Switchboard Dependency] Fully depends on switchboard::aggregator module - what if Switchboard is paused or malfunctioning? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [current_result() Trust] Blindly trusts current_result() without verifying it represents consensus - can individual feeds manipulate this? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [max_timestamp_ms() Validation] Doesn't validate that max_timestamp_ms() is reasonable - can future timestamps be provided? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [result().value() Cast] Casts to u256 assuming it fits - can negative or out-of-range values cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Aggregator Liveness] Doesn't check if aggregator is active before adding - can dead aggregators be added? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Type: String] [Asset Type Format] asset_type is std::ascii::String with no format validation - can special characters or empty strings cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Case Sensitivity] Asset type comparison is case-sensitive - can 'SUI' and 'sui' coexist as different assets? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Asset Type Collision] No namespace or prefix for asset types - can cross-protocol collisions occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Asset Type Cleanup] Removing asset doesn't prevent future vault operations from trying to use it - can this cause runtime panics? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Constant: MAX_UPDATE_INTERVAL] [Default Safety] Set to 60 seconds - is this sufficient for all market conditions and network congestion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Constant: DEFAULT_DEX_SLIPPAGE] [Slippage Safety] Set to 1% (100 bps) - is this safe across all DEX operations and market volatilities? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [No Minimum] Can be set to 1ms making all prices appear stale - should there be a minimum enforced? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Slippage Extremes] Can be 0 (DoS) or u256::MAX (no protection) - should bounds be enforced? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceInfo] [No Bounds Fields] price, last_updated have no min/max bounds - can extreme values cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceInfo] [Missing Fields] No price staleness flag or health indicator - can unhealthy prices be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: OracleConfig] [Mutable Shared Object] Being a mutable shared object, can concurrent mutations cause data races? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: OracleConfig] [No Admin Cap] No owner or admin capability stored - authorization relies solely on package access, is this sufficient? (High)"
