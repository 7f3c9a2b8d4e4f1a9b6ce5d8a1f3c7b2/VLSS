  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Fee Cap] Does fee_config.calculate_unstake_fee() enforce maximum BPS caps, or can fees exceed sui.value() causing split() to fail? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Redistribution Cap] Does fee_config.calculate_unstake_fee_redistribution() validate that redistribution_amount <= redeem_fee_amount, preventing underflow at line 309? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Version Check] At line 226, manage.check_version() is called. If version is outdated, does the entire transaction revert, or can partial state changes occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Pause State] At line 338, manage.set_paused() updates pause state. Can concurrent transactions check_not_paused() after pause is set but before state is committed, causing race condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Version Increment] At line 343, manage.migrate_version() is called. Can this be called multiple times to artificially inflate version number, breaking version-dependent logic? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake_entry()] [System State] At line 179, &mut SuiSystemState is passed. Can an attacker pass a fake SuiSystemState object to manipulate validator data? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake_entry()] [System State] At line 271, &mut SuiSystemState is passed. Can modifications to system_state during unstake affect subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: refresh()] [System State Mutation] At line 514, validator_pool.refresh() mutates system_state. Can concurrent refresh() calls from different modules cause system_state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: refresh()] [Reward Calculation] At line 518, if new_total_supply < old_total_supply (slashing), reward_fee=0. Should slashing losses be socialized across all LST holders by burning LST supply? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Special Case Logic] At line 259, the condition (old_sui_supply > 0 && old_lst_supply == 0) bypasses ratio check. How can old_sui_supply > 0 while old_lst_supply == 0? Is this a recovery mechanism? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Fee Redistribution] At lines 305-306, redistribution_amount is calculated. If last holder unstakes, redistribution_amount=0. Should the last holder pay full fees to prevent gaming the last-holder position? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: get_amount_out()] [Fee Application Order] At line 620, fees are deducted from amount_in before conversion. But in actual stake(), fees are deducted after determining sui_balance. Is this preview function accurate? (Medium)"
