  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Struct: QueueFeeTypeAdded] [Event Struct Immutability] The event struct has copy+drop but no store - can events be dropped silently without being emitted if actuate() panics after event::emit()? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Event Fields] The event only includes queue_id and fee_type but not the authority who added it or timestamp - does this create insufficient audit trails? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Consistency] If queue.add_fee_type<T>() silently returns when fee type already exists, but event is emitted anyway, can off-chain state diverge from on-chain fee_types vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Duplicate Prevention] The underlying add_fee_type() checks contains() before push_back - if two concurrent transactions call run<T>() with the same type, can both pass contains check and cause duplicate additions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vector Growth Unbounded] There is no limit on how many fee types can be added - can an attacker add thousands of unique coin types to bloat queue.fee_types storage and cause gas DoS for queue operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Type Ordering] If add_fee_type() uses push_back without sorted insertion, can the order of fee types in the vector affect queue behavior or fee selection logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Reference Safety] The function takes &mut Queue but only calls add_fee_type which may not validate queue invariants - can this leave the queue in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Transaction Atomicity] If add_fee_type() modifies multiple queue fields atomically, but actuate() does not enforce full transaction rollback on partial failure, can queue state be corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Reentrancy] If add_fee_type() calls external contracts or emits events that trigger callbacks, can an attacker re-enter actuate() before the first call completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Public Function Exposure] The validate() function is public and can be called separately from run() - can attackers probe queue authority and version without triggering events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Package Visibility] The actuate() function has default package visibility - can other modules in the switchboard package call it directly bypassing validate()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Entry Function Pattern] The run() entry function combines validate + actuate - if validate passes but actuate fails, is there proper error handling or can it leave queue in intermediate state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Composition] Can run() be composed with other queue actions in a single transaction to bypass per-action validation or create unexpected state combinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Stateless Validation] The validate() function does not modify state - can this lead to TOCTOU bugs where queue state changes between validate() and actuate()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Module Structure] [Function Separation] The separation of validate/actuate/run functions may allow privilege escalation if internal modules call actuate() without proper authorization checks (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Leakage] The error constants EInvalidAuthority and EInvalidQueueVersion are descriptive - can attackers use these to map queue internals and plan attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert Order] Version is checked before authority - if version check fails, authority check is skipped - can this create information leakage about queue version distribution? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Checks] There are no checks for queue being paused, frozen, or in maintenance mode - can fee types be added during unsafe queue states? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Failure Recovery] If run() aborts after validate() succeeds, there is no cleanup or rollback mechanism - can repeated failures leave the queue in a degraded state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Silent Failure] The add_fee_type() function returns early if fee type exists - should actuate() return a boolean or error to indicate no-op vs success? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Reference Borrow] The function borrows &Queue immutably, then run() borrows &mut Queue - can borrow checker be bypassed in Move if queue is borrowed both ways in same scope? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] An attacker with authority can repeatedly call run<T>() with the same fee type - even though add_fee_type() early returns, does validate() + event emission still cost gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Storage Costs] Each push_back to fee_types increases storage costs - can an attacker with authority add maximum fee types to make queue operations prohibitively expensive? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Instantiation Cost] If type T has complex generic parameters or large metadata, does type_name::get<Coin<T>>() have unbounded gas cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Batch Attack] Can an attacker submit many run<T1>(), run<T2>(), ..., run<Tn>() calls in parallel to exhaust block gas limit and prevent legitimate queue operations? (Medium)"
