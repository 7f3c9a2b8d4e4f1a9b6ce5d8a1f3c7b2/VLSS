  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Multiple Reward Types] Since reward_indices and unclaimed_rewards are Tables indexed by TypeName, can an attacker create fake TypeNames to pollute the tables and cause DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Index Initialization Race] If two transactions simultaneously call update_reward() for a new reward_type, can both add the key to reward_indices, causing duplicate entries or state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reset_unclaimed_rewards()] [Type Mismatch] If RewardCoinType does not match any TypeName in unclaimed_rewards, will borrow_mut() cause a panic instead of gracefully handling the missing key? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: get_receipt_reward()] [Non-Existent Reward Type] If reward_type does not exist in unclaimed_rewards, get_receipt_reward() returns 0—can this hide initialization bugs where rewards should exist but tables were not properly set up? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: get_receipt_rewards()] [Empty Vector Input] If reward_types is an empty vector, get_receipt_rewards() returns an empty vector—can this cause unexpected behavior in calling code expecting at least one reward? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Precision Loss] Does vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() properly handle decimal precision, or can rounding errors accumulate across many update_reward() calls, causing reward shortfalls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Table Key Collision] Can TypeName collisions occur in reward_indices or unclaimed_rewards tables if two reward types resolve to the same TypeName through different module paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Table Memory Leak] If reward types are added to reward_indices and unclaimed_rewards but never removed, can this cause unbounded table growth and state bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: new_vault_receipt_info()] [Uninitialized Tables] If new_vault_receipt_info() is called with empty Tables, and later operations assume pre-populated tables, can this cause panics or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reward_indices_mut()] [Direct Table Mutation] Since reward_indices_mut() returns &mut Table, can external modules directly remove keys or corrupt the table structure, bypassing update_reward() logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: unclaimed_rewards_mut()] [Reward Theft] Can a malicious module use unclaimed_rewards_mut() to drain unclaimed_rewards for one receipt and credit them to another, enabling reward theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Oracle Price Precision] If vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() uses fixed-point arithmetic with specific decimal places, can mismatched decimals between reward_idx and shares cause incorrect acc_reward calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Share Precision] If new_shares is calculated with truncation/rounding in the calling module, can users exploit this to receive more shares than entitled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Principal Precision] If claimable_principal is derived from share-to-principal conversion with rounding, can repeated small withdrawals accumulate rounding errors in users' favor? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Reentrancy Attack] Can an attacker call update_after_request_deposit() through a malicious callback during deposit processing to manipulate pending_deposit_balance mid-transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Reentrancy in Emission] The update_reward() function emits VaultReceiptInfoUpdated event—can an event handler reenter and call update_reward() again, causing double reward accrual? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Callback Reentrancy] Can update_after_execute_withdraw() be reentered via a malicious receive hook to execute multiple withdrawals with the same shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Claim Reentrancy] Can an attacker reenter update_after_claim_principal() during the claim process to claim the same claimable_principal multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_request_deposit() & update_after_request_withdraw()] [Concurrent Requests] Can an attacker call update_after_request_deposit() and update_after_request_withdraw() in the same transaction to create conflicting pending operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_cancel_deposit() & update_after_execute_deposit()] [Race Condition] Can update_after_cancel_deposit() and update_after_execute_deposit() be called in the same block, causing pending_deposit_balance to go negative or desynchronize? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_execute_withdraw() & update_after_claim_principal()] [Claim Before Execute] Can update_after_claim_principal() be called before update_after_execute_withdraw(), allowing claiming of principal that hasn't been properly withdrawn yet? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_reward() & reset_unclaimed_rewards()] [Reward Timing] If reset_unclaimed_rewards() is called immediately after update_reward(), can another transaction front-run to call update_reward() again, causing rewards to be counted twice? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Functions: update_after_execute_deposit() & update_reward()] [Share Update Race] If update_after_execute_deposit() increases shares but update_reward() hasn't been called yet, can the user miss rewards accrued during the deposit processing window? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Invariant: Status-Pending Consistency] Can status be NORMAL_STATUS while pending_deposit_balance or pending_withdraw_shares is non-zero, violating the state machine invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Invariant: Share Conservation] Can the sum of shares across all operations be manipulated such that total shares minted exceeds total shares burned plus existing shares? (Critical)"
