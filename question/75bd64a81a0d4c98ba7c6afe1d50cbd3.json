  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Bypass] Can an attacker pass a malicious guardian_queue with version != 1 before validation, allowing incompatible queue versions to be referenced, potentially causing downstream oracle verification failures or breaking upgrade paths? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Manipulation] If EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1, can future protocol upgrades cause all new queue initializations to fail against upgraded guardian queues with version 2+, creating a permanent DoS condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] Can an attacker exploit the version check by creating a guardian queue that reports version 1 but has incompatible internal state structure, causing silent data corruption when the new oracle queue references it? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Rollback Attack] Can an attacker downgrade a guardian_queue's version field back to 1 through a package upgrade vulnerability, allowing outdated queue initialization logic to be used against a newer guardian queue implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Cross-Version Reference] If validate() only checks guardian_queue.version() == 1, can the newly created queue have a different version than its guardian, creating mismatched version pairs that break guardian queue override mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestations Bypass] Can an attacker set min_attestations to exactly 0 and trigger the error, but then in a separate transaction create a queue with min_attestations=1 that is effectively useless but passes validation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Excessive Min Attestations] Can an attacker set min_attestations to u64::MAX, creating a queue that can never satisfy attestation requirements since the oracle count would need to exceed maximum possible oracles, causing permanent DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestations Integer Overflow] If min_attestations is set to a very large value (e.g., 2^63), can downstream oracle aggregation logic overflow when multiplying by oracle count or performing attestation threshold checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestations Mismatch] Can an attacker create a queue with min_attestations=1 but guardian_queue has min_attestations=100, creating security inconsistency where child queue accepts single attestation but parent requires 100? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestations Economic Attack] Can an attacker set min_attestations to 1000 knowing only 10 oracles exist in the guardian queue, creating a queue that appears valid but can never produce aggregator results, wasting user initialization fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Validity Underflow] Can an attacker set oracle_validity_length_ms to 1 millisecond, causing oracle data to become stale immediately after submission, forcing continuous oracle updates and creating DoS through excessive update costs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Validity Overflow] Can an attacker set oracle_validity_length_ms to u64::MAX (~584 million years), allowing oracle data to remain valid indefinitely even if stale, enabling price manipulation through outdated oracle submissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Validity Time Manipulation] If oracle_validity_length_ms is 1000ms but block timestamps only update every 5 seconds, can attackers exploit timestamp granularity to keep expired oracle data valid for up to 5 extra seconds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Validity Mismatch] Can an attacker create a queue with oracle_validity_length_ms=1ms while guardian_queue has oracle_validity_length_ms=1 year, causing child queue to reject all oracle submissions that parent considers valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Validity Conversion Error] If oracle_validity_length_ms is added to block timestamps in downstream logic without overflow checks, can attacker use u64::MAX-1 to cause timestamp overflow and break oracle staleness validation?

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Authority Zero Address] Can an attacker set authority to @0x0, creating a queue with no valid owner that cannot be managed, updated, or have oracles added, locking the queue configuration permanently?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Mismatch] Since run() is a public entry function, can any address call it and set themselves as authority, creating arbitrary oracle queues that might be confused with official protocol queues?
