  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call validate() with a forged TxContext where ctx.sender() matches aggregator.authority through transaction manipulation or context injection, bypassing the has_authority check? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Bypass] What happens if aggregator.version() returns a value different from EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION (1) due to version drift - can this permanently lock authority changes even for legitimate owners? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Race Condition] Can two concurrent validate() calls with the same aggregator create a race condition where both pass validation but the second actuate() call uses stale authority data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Logic Error] If aggregator.has_authority(ctx) internally uses weak equality checks (e.g., string comparison instead of address comparison), can an attacker craft an address that passes the check? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker who gains temporary authority immediately set authority to an inaccessible address (e.g., @0x0), permanently locking the aggregator? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Upgrade Attack] If EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION is hardcoded to 1, how are version upgrades handled - can this create a scenario where upgraded aggregators become inaccessible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Check Timing] Does validate() check authority at call time or at validation time - can authority change between these moments in a multi-step transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Leakage] Do the error codes EInvalidAuthority and EInvalidAggregatorVersion leak sensitive information that helps attackers understand system state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Multiple Validation Bypass] Can validate() be called multiple times in the same transaction with different contexts to bypass authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Aggregator Reference Mutability] Since validate() takes &Aggregator (immutable reference), can the aggregator be modified between validate() and actuate() calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Zero Address Validation] Can new_authority be set to @0x0 or other invalid addresses, permanently locking oracle updates since no one can sign from those addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Self-Transfer Attack] If new_authority equals existing_authority, does the function still emit an event and waste gas without any state change? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Authority Reversion Attack] Can an attacker who temporarily gains authority set new_authority back to the old authority to create event spam or DoS the event system? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Timing] Is the AggregatorAuthorityUpdated event emitted before or after aggregator.set_authority() - can this create race conditions for off-chain listeners? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Validation] Why doesn't actuate() re-validate authority since it's a separate function - can it be called independently if made public? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Inconsistency] Between capturing existing_authority for the event and calling set_authority(), can the aggregator's authority be modified by another transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering Attack] If multiple authority changes happen in quick succession, can the events be emitted out of order, confusing off-chain systems tracking authority? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Authority Chain Break] If new_authority is set to an address that doesn't exist or is controlled by a malicious contract, can this break oracle update chains? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Aggregator ID Capture] Is aggregator.id() captured atomically with existing_authority - can the ID change during the function execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Rollback Logic] If event::emit() fails, does set_authority() still persist - can this create state/event inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Atomic Execution] Are validate() and actuate() executed atomically in run() - can the aggregator state change between these two calls? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Re-entrancy Attack] Can run() be re-entered during actuate() execution to set authority multiple times with stale validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Context Manipulation] Since run() passes ctx to validate() but actuate() doesn't use it, can ctx be manipulated between validation and actuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running Attack] Can an attacker observe a pending run() transaction and front-run it to change authority first, causing the original transaction to fail or behave unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker force run() to consume maximum gas by triggering validation failures after expensive operations? (Medium)"
