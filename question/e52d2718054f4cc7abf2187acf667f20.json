  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Secondary Disabled] Can an attacker disable the secondary oracle through admin functions, then manipulate the primary oracle alone to bypass dual-source validation during price difference checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Secondary Type Mismatch] If secondary oracle uses different price scaling or decimal conventions than primary, can the comparison logic produce false positives/negatives in price difference validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Bypass] When both prices are fresh, if price_diff_threshold1 or price_diff_threshold2 are set to excessively large values, can manipulated prices pass validation despite significant divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Severity Level] If validate_price_difference returns level_warning instead of level_normal or level_error, the function continues execution - can this warning state be exploited to use questionable prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Timer] Can the diff_threshold2_timer be manipulated to extend the allowable duration for price divergence, enabling prolonged exploitation windows using mismatched oracle data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Max Duration] If max_duration_within_thresholds is set incorrectly, can prices that diverge beyond safe levels be accepted for extended periods, enabling arbitrage attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Invalid Price Diff] When invalid_price_diff error is returned with price 0, can vault contracts that don't check error codes treat this as a successful zero-price fetch, enabling free asset withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Difference Calculation] Can integer overflow in price difference calculations within validate_price_difference cause wrapping, making large divergences appear small and passing validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Threshold Configuration] Can admin misconfiguration set threshold1 > threshold2, inverting the validation logic and accepting prices that should be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Freshness Race] Can both primary and secondary prices become stale simultaneously during network congestion, triggering the no_available_price error and DoS-ing all vault operations dependent on this asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Single Source Freshness] When only primary is fresh (line 70-71), no price diff validation occurs - can an attacker manipulate the primary source alone without secondary cross-validation during this state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Freshness Flip] Can timing attacks cause is_primary_price_fresh to flip from true to false between check and use, causing the wrong final_price assignment in race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Freshness Asymmetry] If only secondary is fresh, final_price switches without additional validation - can this be exploited by ensuring primary always goes stale through DoS attacks on primary oracle provider? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Price Range] Can maximum_effective_price and minimum_effective_price be set to extreme values (0 to MAX) that effectively disable range validation, allowing any price to pass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Span Percentage] If maximum_allowed_span_percentage is misconfigured to 100% or higher, can prices that deviate drastically from historical values still pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical Price] Can historical_price be manipulated or become stale (exceeding historical_price_ttl), causing validate_price_range_and_history to accept abnormal final_price values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical TTL] If historical_price_ttl is very short and historical data isn't updated frequently, can legitimate price movements be rejected as invalid, DoS-ing vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Historical Update Time] Can historical_updated_time be zero or stale, causing comparison logic to always fail and reject valid prices, or always pass invalid prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Invalid Final Price] When validate_price_range_and_history returns false, error is returned with price 0 - can this create DoS conditions or be misinterpreted by calling contracts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Range Validation Bypass] Can final_price be exactly at maximum_effective_price or minimum_effective_price boundary, and does the validation use inclusive or exclusive comparison, potentially accepting out-of-range prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Error Code Collision] Can different error conditions return the same error code, causing calling contracts to misinterpret the failure reason and apply incorrect recovery logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Zero Price Return] All error paths return (error_code, 0) - can vault contracts fail to check the error code and treat 0 as a legitimate price for asset valuation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Success Code] If constants::success() returns 0 (same as error states), can calling contracts confuse success with errors, leading to incorrect price processing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Silent Failures] Are there any code paths where the function could return success with an incorrect price without triggering any error condition? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Supra Oracle] Can an attacker provide a fake or manipulated OracleHolder object that returns attacker-controlled prices when get_price_from_adaptor queries it? (Critical)"
