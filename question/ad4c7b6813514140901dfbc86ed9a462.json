(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: execute_borrow()] [Validation Bypass] If validation::validate_borrow only checks reserve capacity but not user-specific limits, can an attacker borrow up to reserve capacity regardless of their collateral?
