  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Very Small Values] For obligations with dust amounts (< 1 USD), does the DECIMAL division round these to 0, potentially hiding many small positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Very Large Values] For whale positions with billions in USD value, can u256 operations still overflow despite the large type, especially in intermediate calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Clock Object Validity] Can an attacker pass a malicious Clock object that returns manipulated timestamps to bypass freshness checks or affect interest calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Freshness Window] What is the freshness threshold in assert_price_is_fresh, and can attackers time their calls to exploit the edges of the window? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Timestamp Dependency] Does compound_interest use clock timestamp for interest calculation, and can time-based attacks (e.g., waiting for advantageous timestamps) be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Timestamp Overflow] Can clock.timestamp_ms() overflow if called far in the future, causing incorrect staleness tracking in finish_update_asset_value? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [DoS via Assert] If assert_price_is_fresh fails for any reserve, does the entire update revert, allowing an attacker to DoS position updates by letting one price go stale? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [DoS via Large Obligation] Can an attacker create an obligation with maximum allowed deposits/borrows to make parse_suilend_obligation consume excessive gas and DoS the vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [DoS via Compound Failure] If compounding one reserve fails or requires excessive gas, can this block all position updates for that asset? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [DoS via Vector Size] Can the vector of reserve indices grow unbounded, causing memory or computation DoS when iterating? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Underwater Position Masking] By returning 0 when borrows exceed deposits, does the adaptor hide insolvency, allowing the vault to continue operations when it should trigger loss tolerance or liquidation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Value Deflation Attack] Can an attacker manipulate Suilend state to deflate the usd_value calculated, then withdraw from the vault before correction, stealing from other depositors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Collateral Overvaluation] If ctoken_market_value overvalues deposits due to price manipulation or stale data, can this enable over-borrowing that leads to bad debt? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Debt Undervaluation] If the borrow rate calculation underestimates debt due to rate manipulation or staleness, can borrowers extract more value than their collateral should allow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Asset Type Mismatch] If the asset_type parameter doesn't match the actual type of the obligation cap stored in the vault, will get_defi_asset fail cleanly or cause silent corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Obligation ID Corruption] If obligation_cap.obligation_id() returns an invalid or corrupted ID, will lending_market.obligation() handle this safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [Index Consistency] Are reserve_array_index values guaranteed to remain valid for the lifetime of the obligation, or can reserve reordering invalidate stored indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Missing Price Update] The comment at lines 12-19 states prices must be updated first, but the function doesn't enforce this - can forgetting to update prices lead to exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Documentation Mismatch] Does the actual implementation match the documented requirement for calling refresh_reserve_price first, or is there a gap that creates security risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Cumulative Rate Division] In new_cumulative_borrow_rate.div(cumulative_borrow_rate), if cumulative_borrow_rate is 1 and new_cumulative_borrow_rate is very small due to precision, does this cause incorrect multiplier?
