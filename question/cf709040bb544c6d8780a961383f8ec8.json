(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Inversion Attack] Can an attacker set maximum_effective_price below the current minimum_effective_price, creating an invalid price range that rejects all prices?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed()] [TTL Bypass] Can an attacker set historical_price_ttl to u64::MAX, causing the oracle to accept infinitely old historical prices and bypassing freshness checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed()] [TTL Zero Attack] Can an attacker set historical_price_ttl to 0, causing all historical price lookups to immediately expire and forcing dependence on live prices that may be manipulatable?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_pyth_oracle_provider_config()] [Invalid Pair ID] Can an attacker provide an empty or malformed pair_id vector, causing Pyth price lookups to fail silently or return incorrect prices? (High)",
