  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Incomplete] Does validate() only check 3 conditions (version, min_attestations>0, oracle_validity_length_ms>0) but miss critical validations like queue_key format, authority validity, or fee reasonableness? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Guardian Queue Consistency] Does validate() check that guardian_queue is actually shared and accessible, or can attacker pass a guardian_queue that will be deleted before actuate() uses its ID? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Module Reentrancy] Can calling queue::new() at line 43 trigger a callback to attacker-controlled code before actuate() completes, allowing attacker to manipulate queue state before event emission? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Non-Atomic Queue Creation] If queue::new() shares the object and then returns, can another transaction access the queue before OracleQueueCreated event is emitted, creating race condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multiple Queue Creation] Since run() is public entry, can an attacker call it multiple times in parallel with same parameters, creating multiple queues with identical configuration causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Exhaustion] Can an attacker pass extremely large queue_key or name parameters that cause run() to exceed gas limits during queue::new() storage allocation, griefing legitimate queue creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Cost] If queue_key is 10MB, does emitting it in OracleQueueCreated event at line 60 cause excessive gas costs or event size limits, failing the transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Cost Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly call run() with invalid parameters (min_attestations=0) to waste guardian_queue read costs and validation gas for honest queue creators? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Constructor Assumptions] If queue::new() expects non-zero fee but actuate() passes fee=0, can this cause queue to be created in invalid state where oracle submissions fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Table Initialization] Does queue::new() properly initialize the existing_oracles table, or can a freshly created queue have corrupted oracle mapping that breaks oracle registration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Version Assignment] If queue::new() assigns VERSION=1 but EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION=1 in init_action, can version mismatch after upgrade cause initialized queues to be immediately considered invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Fee Type Initialization] Does queue::new() initialize fee_types to only SUI, and can attacker never add additional fee types through init_action, limiting payment options permanently? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue last_queue_override_ms] If queue::new() initializes last_queue_override_ms=0, can attacker immediately override queue with guardian queue since timestamp check would be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestations Boundary] If min_attestations=1, can a single malicious oracle control all aggregator results, violating security assumptions of multi-oracle consensus?
