  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the has_authority() check by manipulating the TxContext sender before validate() is called, allowing unauthorized fee type additions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] If Queue.has_authority() relies on ctx.sender(), can an attacker use a delegated signing pattern or multi-sig wallet to bypass authority checks when the queue authority is a different address? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authorization Bypass] Can validate() be called directly by an attacker to check authority status without triggering actuate(), allowing reconnaissance for timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] If queue.has_authority(ctx) returns true for multiple addresses due to implementation flaws in Queue module, can unauthorized actors add malicious fee types? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authorization Bypass] Since validate() uses &mut TxContext, can an attacker manipulate the context between validate() and actuate() calls to change the effective sender? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Race Condition] If queue authority can be changed in the same transaction before validate() is called, can an attacker front-run authority changes to add fee types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Authorization Check] The actuate() function is not public entry and only package-visible, but does not re-check authority - can internal package functions bypass authorization by calling actuate() directly? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Persistence] If has_authority() check passes but queue authority changes before actuate() executes in the same transaction, does the action still proceed with stale authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Bypass] If Queue.version() returns a mutable reference that can be modified mid-transaction, can an attacker temporarily set version to 1, pass validation, then revert it? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] The EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded to 1 - if Queue module upgrades to version 2, will all queue_add_fee_coin_action calls permanently fail, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Inconsistency] If multiple Queue instances exist with different versions, can an attacker add fee types only to version 1 queues, creating inconsistent fee configurations across the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Upgrade Path] When Queue upgrades to version 2+, there is no migration path in this action module - will legacy fee type additions be blocked permanently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade Attack] If Queue.version() can be downgraded from 2 to 1 by an attacker, can they bypass new security checks introduced in version 2 while still adding fee types? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Integer Overflow] If queue.version() uses u8 and increments past 255, will it overflow back to 0, allowing unexpected version matches with EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION=1? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Parameter Manipulation] Can an attacker call run<FakeCoin>() with a malicious coin type that mimics legitimate coins but has backdoor mint/burn functions, corrupting fee accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Safety] The function accepts any type T without validating if Coin<T> is a registered coin type - can attackers add non-existent or malicious coin types to fee_types vector? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Name Spoofing] If type_name::get<Coin<T>>() can be spoofed or collide with legitimate coin type names, can an attacker add duplicate/conflicting fee types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Generic Type Constraint Missing] There is no constraint that T must have drop, store, or key abilities - can adding fee types with incompatible abilities cause runtime failures when Queue tries to instantiate Coin<T>? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Name Collision] If two different modules define coins with identical fully-qualified names, will type_name::get<Coin<T>>() distinguish them correctly or allow fee type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Phantom Type Attack] Can an attacker use phantom type parameters or wrapper types to bypass intended coin type restrictions and add unsupported fee types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Parameter Reordering] If a coin type has multiple generic parameters Coin<T, U>, can parameter reordering Coin<U, T> create distinct but semantically identical fee types causing duplication? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Order] The QueueFeeTypeAdded event is emitted after queue.add_fee_type<T>() succeeds - if add_fee_type reverts after event emission, can off-chain monitors have inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Integrity] The event uses type_name::get<Coin<T>>() directly - if this differs from what add_fee_type() stores internally, can event data be misleading for monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Flooding] There is no rate limiting on QueueFeeTypeAdded events - can an attacker spam run<T>() calls with different types to flood event logs and cause DoS for indexers? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] If the same fee type is added multiple times (though add_fee_type checks contains), could event emission before the contains check leak information about failed additions? (Low)"
