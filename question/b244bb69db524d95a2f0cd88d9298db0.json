  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [LST Price Feed] If this queue is used for LST price feeds in Volo liquid staking, could manipulated configs enable incorrect LST/SUI ratio calculations during stake/unstake operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Vault Value Updates] If queue configs change mid-operation while Volo Vault is calculating total_usd_value, could this create inconsistencies in the assets_value_updated staleness tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Oracle Usage] If Volo Vault adaptors for Navi, Suilend, Cetus, or Momentum rely on this queue's oracle, could config changes mid-operation cause adaptor health checks to use incorrect price data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Upgrade Path] The EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION is hardcoded. If Queue module upgrades to v2, is there a migration path for existing queues, or will they be permanently unable to update configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Immutability] If this action module is deployed as immutable, can config update logic never be fixed if vulnerabilities are discovered, forcing deployment of a new action module and Queue migration? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Backward Compatibility] If the Queue module's set_configs() signature changes, will existing deployed action modules fail at runtime, and is there a rollback mechanism? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Module Trust Boundary] This module trusts Queue.has_authority() completely. If the Queue module has a vulnerability allowing authority bypass, this action provides no additional protection. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Trust] Off-chain systems may trust QueueConfigsUpdated events. If an attacker compromises authority or exploits Queue module, could fake events be emitted to mislead monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Dependency Chain] This module is part of a dependency chain (Switchboard -> Volo Vault -> Volo Protocol). Could vulnerabilities cascade, where a config manipulation here propagates to Volo Vault value calculations and LST ratios? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Front-Running] Can an authority with malicious intent front-run large oracle query transactions (from Volo Vault operations) by increasing fees just before execution, extracting excess value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Cartel] If multiple authorities collude, could they manipulate min_attestations and fee settings to favor certain oracle operators, centralizing the oracle network? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Revenue Extraction] Can an authority change fee_recipient to extract revenue from Volo protocol's oracle usage without protocol governance approval? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Timestamp Manipulation] While oracle_validity_length_ms is validated > 0, is there protection against block timestamp manipulation attacks where validators could manipulate timestamps to keep stale oracle data valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Clock Drift] In distributed systems, clock drift between nodes could cause oracle attestations to be considered valid or invalid inconsistently if oracle_validity_length_ms is set very low. Is this handled? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Consistency] The function modifies queue state in actuate() after validation. If the Queue object is used in other modules simultaneously, could there be state inconsistency issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Idempotency] If run() is called multiple times with the same parameters, are there any state accumulation issues, or is it perfectly idempotent? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Switchboard Assumptions] The module assumes Switchboard Queue module behaviors. If Switchboard upgrades their queue implementation with breaking changes, could this action module become incompatible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Queue Lifecycle] If a Queue enters a deprecated or sunset state in Switchboard, should config updates be blocked, or could updating a deprecated queue cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [u64 Overflow] Can any of the u64 parameters (fee, min_attestations, oracle_validity_length_ms) be set to values that could cause overflow in downstream calculations in the Queue module? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Zero Value Edge Case] While min_attestations and oracle_validity_length_ms are validated > 0, the fee can be 0. Could a zero fee create division-by-zero errors in fee calculation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Maximum Value Edge Case] If fee is set to u64::MAX (18,446,744,073,709,551,615), could this cause overflow when accumulated with other fees or multiplied in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Step Attack] Can an attacker first call run() to set min_attestations to 1, then in a second transaction submit a fraudulent oracle attestation that meets the lowered threshold, manipulating Volo Vault prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Configuration Sequence] Could an attacker chain multiple run() calls in a single transaction with progressively more malicious configs, and if any intermediate config enables another exploit, execute it before final config? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validation Bypass via Sequence] Could calling run() immediately after Queue creation bypass some checks that assume Queue is already initialized with safe defaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [String Encoding] The name parameter is a String type. Are there encoding issues if name contains non-UTF8 or special characters that could cause issues in set_configs()? (Low)"
