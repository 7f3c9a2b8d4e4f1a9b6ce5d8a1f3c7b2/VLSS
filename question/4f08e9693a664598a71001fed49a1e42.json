  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator() + remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Timing Attack] Can an attacker add and remove aggregators rapidly to cause vault operations to fail intermittently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator() + update_price()] [State Inconsistency] If aggregator is changed while update_price() is in progress, can the wrong price be updated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval() + get_asset_price()] [Parameter Race] Can update_interval be changed between the staleness check and price return, invalidating the check? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price() + change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Decimal Mismatch] If aggregator changes mid-normalization, can this use wrong decimals for calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Pow Overflow] pow(10, 9 - decimals) can produce large values - can this overflow when multiplied with price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Multiplication Overflow] price * pow(10, x) can overflow u256 for high prices - is there overflow protection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Division by Zero] If pow(10, decimals - 9) somehow evaluates to 0, division will panic - can this occur? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Timestamp Arithmetic] last_updated.diff(now) uses u64 arithmetic - can overflow/underflow occur with extreme timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Subtraction Underflow] now - max_timestamp can underflow if max_timestamp > now - is this checked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Zero Decimals] If decimals == 0, pow(10, 9) multiplies price by 1 billion - can this overflow for any reasonable price? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Max Decimals] If decimals == 255, pow(10, 246) will overflow - is there decimal validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [18 Decimals] For standard 18-decimal tokens, division by pow(10, 9) truncates - can this cause significant precision loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Precision Loss Accumulation] Repeated normalization can accumulate rounding errors - can this be exploited over many operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Clock Dependency] Relies on clock.timestamp_ms() which can be manipulated within consensus bounds - can this enable stale price attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Future Timestamps] If max_timestamp_ms() is in the future, the staleness check is skipped - can Switchboard manipulation enable this? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Timestamp Monotonicity] No check that new last_updated > old last_updated - can prices be backdated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Initial Timestamp] Sets last_updated to current time, but price might be older - can stale initial prices be added? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Address Verification] Doesn't verify aggregator.id().to_address() is a valid object - can fake addresses be added? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Aggregator Match] Checks aggregator address matches but doesn't verify aggregator ownership - can stolen aggregator references be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Address Overwrite] Overwrites aggregator address without validation - can this point to malicious aggregators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceInfo] [Address Storage] Stores aggregator as address not object reference - can this become stale if object is deleted? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Event: AssetPriceUpdated] [Price Accuracy] Event emits price before it's fully committed - can event show price that doesn't match final state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Event: SwitchboardAggregatorChanged] [Event Order] Emits before state is fully updated - can events be replayed to cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Event: OracleConfigUpgraded] [Version Consistency] Emits VERSION constant not actual self.version - can these differ? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Event: DexSlippageSet] [Missing Validation] Events emitted without validating parameter values - can events show invalid configurations? (Low)"
