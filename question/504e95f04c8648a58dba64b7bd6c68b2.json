  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_supra_oracle_provider_config()] [Pair ID Conversion] Does adaptor_supra::pair_id_to_vector() properly convert u32 pair_id to vector<u8>, or can overflow/truncation cause wrong Supra feeds to be referenced? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_supra_oracle_provider_config()] [Duplicate Supra] Can both Pyth and Supra configs be created for the same feed_id, and if so, which takes precedence if both are enabled as primary? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pyth_price_oracle_provider_pair_id()] [Pair ID Switch] Can pair_id be changed while the provider is actively serving as primary, causing price lookups to fail or return wrong asset prices mid-operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_supra_price_source_pair_id()] [Invalid Vector] Can set_supra_price_source_pair_id() be called with a pair_id vector that's empty or has wrong length, bypassing the u32 conversion and causing Supra lookups to fail?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: disable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Primary Disable] Can disable_pyth_oracle_provider() successfully disable a provider that's currently set as primary, breaking price feed functionality without proper fallback? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: disable_supra_oracle_provider()] [Disable All] Can an attacker disable both Pyth and Supra providers leaving no valid price sources, causing permanent DoS for that feed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: enable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Race Condition] Can enable/disable be called in rapid succession causing state inconsistencies where oracle_provider_configs.enable doesn't match the actual usage?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: enable_supra_oracle_provider()] [Invalid Enable] Can a provider be enabled even if its pair_id is invalid or the external oracle contract doesn't exist, causing runtime failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_primary_oracle_provider()] [Disabled Provider] Can set_primary_oracle_provider() set a disabled provider as primary, bypassing the enable check in config::set_primary_oracle_provider()? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_secondary_oracle_provider()] [Empty Provider] Can set_secondary_oracle_provider() set an empty provider (oracle_provider::new_empty_provider()) as secondary, and does this properly indicate no fallback is available? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_secondary_oracle_provider()] [Same Provider] Can primary and secondary be set to the same provider, defeating the purpose of having a fallback and creating circular dependency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_primary_oracle_provider()] [Provider Switch] Can primary provider be switched while price fetches are in progress, causing inconsistent reads where some operations use old provider and others use new?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [All Setter Functions] [Feed Existence] Do all functions that take feed_id parameter properly validate that table::contains(&cfg.feeds, feed_id) before operations, or can some bypass this check? (Medium)",
