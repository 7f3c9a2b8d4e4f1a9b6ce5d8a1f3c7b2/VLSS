  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: value()] [Public Value Access] The value() function at line 26 returns num.value directly - can external contracts misuse this to access raw u128 values without considering the neg flag, causing sign errors in vault calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: neg()] [Public Neg Access] The neg() function at line 34 returns num.neg directly - can external contracts construct Decimals with inconsistent value/neg combinations (e.g., value=0, neg=true) by misusing these accessors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: unpack()] [Destructuring Risk] The unpack() function at line 21 destroys the Decimal struct - if called on a vault balance, can this cause the balance to be unrecoverable, leading to permanent fund lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: new()] [Arbitrary Construction] Since new() at line 17 is public and accepts any u128 and bool, can an attacker construct invalid Decimals (e.g., u128::max with neg=true) that break vault invariants when used in calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: dec()] [Hardcoded Decimals] The dec() function always returns 18 at line 31 - if vault contracts assume different decimal bases, can this mismatch cause incorrect scaling in multi-asset price calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Copy Abuse] Since Decimal has copy ability at line 8, can an attacker duplicate oracle price references across multiple vault operations, causing double-counting in total_usd_value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Drop Risk] Since Decimal has drop ability at line 8, can important vault balance or price values be accidentally dropped without cleanup, causing accounting inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Struct: Decimal] [Store Without Key] Decimal has store but not key at line 8 - can this allow Decimals to be stored in dynamic fields/bags in vault contracts, enabling hidden balance manipulation through field key collisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: min()] [Copy Return] The min() function returns *a or *b (copy) at lines 119/121 - does this create independent Decimal instances that can be mutated separately, breaking vault balance reference integrity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: max()] [Copy Return] The max() function returns *a or *b (copy) at lines 127/129 - if used to select between vault balances, can the copy semantics cause stale balance values to be used in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Branch Coverage] The add() function has 4 branches (lines 73-88) for sign combinations - are all branches tested for overflow, and can an attacker find an untested edge case to exploit in vault share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Sign Preservation] When adding -x + -y at line 73, the result's neg flag is set to true at line 75, but is this correct if add_internal() overflows and wraps to a small positive value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Symmetric Delegation] The function delegates -x + y to sub_internal(b, a) at line 79, and x + -y to sub_internal(a, b) at line 83 - is this delegation symmetric, or can it cause incorrect results in vault reward accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [No Input Validation] The add() function doesn't validate that a and b are non-overflowed Decimals - can an attacker pass pre-wrapped values to cause double overflow in vault total value calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Commutative Property] Is add(a, b) == add(b, a) guaranteed for all inputs, or can sign handling at lines 78-83 break commutativity in vault multi-asset summations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Branch Coverage] The sub() function has 4 branches (lines 97-110) for sign combinations - are all branches tested for underflow, and can an attacker exploit edge cases in vault withdrawal calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Double Negative] When computing -x - -y (which is -x + y), the function calls sub_internal(b, a) at line 98 - is this equivalent to add(a, b) with sign adjustment, or can it produce different results in vault balance updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Negative Result Creation] When computing -x - y at lines 100-103, add_internal() is called and neg is set to true - can this create unexpected negative balances in vault accounting that should never be negative? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Positive + Negative] When computing x - -y (which is x + y) at line 106, add_internal(a, b) is called - can overflow in this addition cause vault balance to wrap incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [No Zero Check] The sub() function doesn't check if result is zero to normalize negative zero - can sub(x, x) produce Decimal{0, true} in some cases, breaking vault equality checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_internal()] [Magnitude Comparison] The function checks b.value > a.value at line 139 and swaps operands - can this cause unexpected sign flips in vault loss calculations where order matters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_internal()] [Automatic Negation] When b.value > a.value, the result is automatically negative at line 140 - can this cause vault profit/loss calculations to be inverted if the caller expected a positive result? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_internal()] [Equal Values] When a.value == b.value, the function returns new(0, false) at line 142 - is this reached correctly, or can off-by-one errors cause non-zero results for equal inputs in vault share calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_internal()] [Ignored Input Signs] The function is called with Decimals that may have neg flags, but only operates on values at lines 139-142 - can this cause incorrect results when called from add()/sub() with sign context? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub_internal()] [Underflow Safety] While the function prevents underflow by checking b.value > a.value at line 139, can integer underflow still occur in edge cases where b.value and a.value are very close to u128 boundaries? (Low)"
