  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [Module Dependency] Can malicious implementation of liquid_staking::create_lst() return compromised AdminCap or LiquidStakingInfo that allows backdoor access to staker funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Mint Failure] If liquid_staking_info.mint() reverts due to protocol pause or limits, does rebalance() properly handle the failure, or will sui_balance be lost? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Redeem Failure] Can liquid_staking::redeem() fail to return expected SUI amount due to slippage, lockup, or protocol issues, causing withdraw() to abort and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Validator Stake Failure] If increase_validator_stake() fails due to validator cap limits or system state issues, are minted LST tokens stuck in lst_balance without earning rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Refresh Side Effects] Can refresh() on line 86 trigger unexpected state changes in liquid_staking_info that affect subsequent operations, creating race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Refresh Race] Between refresh() on line 136 and total_sui_supply() call on line 138, can external transactions modify liquid_staking_info state, causing incorrect fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Module Import] Does dependency on liquid_staking module functions (mint, redeem, create_lst, increase_validator_stake) expose staker to vulnerabilities in that external module? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Module Import] Can fees::new_builder() create malicious fee configurations that extract all value as fees, making the staker unprofitable for users? (Medium)",

(Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent claim_fees() and deposit() calls create race conditions where excess_sui is computed based on stale liabilities, allowing over-extraction of fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Race on Liabilities] Can multiple concurrent deposit() calls cause liabilities to be updated in an inconsistent order with sui_balance, breaking accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Concurrent Unstake] If two withdraw() calls simultaneously trigger unstake_n_sui(), can both drain lst_balance causing the second one to fail or extract more than available? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Race on Balance] Can rebalance() and withdraw() race on sui_balance, where rebalance() withdraws_all() on line 110 while withdraw() expects sui_balance to be available? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Zero Deposit] Can deposit() be called with zero-value Balance<SUI>, incrementing liabilities by 0 but potentially affecting other state or causing unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Zero Withdrawal] Can withdraw(0) be called to trigger refresh() and unstake_n_sui() without actually withdrawing, potentially manipulating state or wasting gas? (Low)",
