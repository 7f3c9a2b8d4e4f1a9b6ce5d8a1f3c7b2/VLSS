  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_config()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker obtain or forge an OracleAdminCap to call create_config() and create unauthorized oracle configurations that could be used to manipulate price feeds across the protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Authorization Bypass] If OracleAdminCap is compromised or transferred to a malicious actor, can they call version_migrate() to upgrade to a malicious version that bypasses security checks in config::version_migrate() or oracle::oracle_version_migrate()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker who gains access to OracleAdminCap call set_pause() to disable oracle functionality during critical operations, causing denial of service for all vault operations dependent on price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Authorization Bypass] If OracleAdminCap is stolen or compromised, can an attacker call create_price_feed() with malicious parameters (extreme prices, zero thresholds) to create poisoned price feeds that corrupt vault valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [All Functions] [Access Control] Since all administrative functions only check for OracleAdminCap without additional verification, can a single compromised admin key lead to complete oracle system takeover affecting all dependent vaults and LST contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_enable_to_price_feed()] [Authorization Abuse] Can a malicious admin with OracleAdminCap disable critical price feeds via set_enable_to_price_feed() during market volatility to prevent legitimate price updates, allowing exploits in dependent protocols? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: enable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Authorization] Can an attacker who obtains OracleAdminCap enable a previously disabled Pyth provider that was disabled due to security issues, reintroducing known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: disable_supra_oracle_provider()] [DoS] Can a compromised admin call disable_supra_oracle_provider() and disable_pyth_oracle_provider() simultaneously to completely disable all oracle providers for a feed, causing permanent DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit version_migrate() to downgrade oracle versions by manipulating config.version or price_oracle.version fields before calling migration, bypassing security improvements? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Version Check] Does config::version_verification() in set_pause() properly validate version before allowing pause state changes, or can an outdated config be paused without proper checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Version Bypass] Can an attacker bypass version_verification() by directly modifying oracle_config.version after it passes the check but before new_price_feed() executes, allowing creation of feeds with incompatible versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [All Setter Functions] [Version Consistency] Do all setter functions (set_max_timestamp_diff_to_price_feed, set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed, etc.) properly verify version before modifications, or can state be corrupted if version_verification() is bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [State Corruption] Can calling version_migrate() while price feeds are actively being used cause state inconsistencies where old and new versions coexist, leading to incorrect price calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_config()] [Version Init] Does config::new_config() initialize version correctly, or can a newly created config have version=0 allowing bypass of version checks in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Pause State Manipulation] Can an attacker repeatedly toggle pause state via set_pause() during critical market events to cause inconsistent oracle behavior where some operations see paused=true while others see paused=false? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [DoS Attack] If set_pause(value=true) is called maliciously, can it prevent all oracle price updates across the system, causing vault operations to fail and funds to be locked indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker exploit a race condition where set_pause() is called simultaneously with price feed updates, causing some updates to succeed while others fail, leading to stale prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Pause Bypass] Does the pause mechanism in config::set_pause() properly block all oracle operations, or can certain critical functions bypass the pause check allowing unauthorized access during emergency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Parameter Overflow] Can an attacker call create_price_feed() with maximum_effective_price=type(u256).max or minimum_effective_price=0 to create price bounds that allow arbitrary price manipulation without triggering safety checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Zero Value Attack] Can create_price_feed() be called with max_timestamp_diff=0, price_diff_threshold1=0, price_diff_threshold2=0 to disable all price validation, allowing stale or manipulated prices to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Threshold Inversion] Can create_price_feed() be called with price_diff_threshold2 < price_diff_threshold1, violating the invariant and causing incorrect threshold logic in config::new_price_feed()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Decimal Manipulation] Does create_price_feed() validate that maximum_effective_price and minimum_effective_price are in correct decimal format (1e9 or 1e18) matching the oracle system, or can mismatched decimals cause price calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Duplicate Feed] Does config::new_price_feed() properly check for existing feeds with the same CoinType or oracle_id to prevent duplicate feeds that could cause confusion in price lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Historical TTL] Can create_price_feed() be called with historical_price_ttl=0, causing immediate invalidation of all historical prices and breaking vault operations that rely on price history?
