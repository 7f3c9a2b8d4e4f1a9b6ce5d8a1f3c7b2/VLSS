  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [DoS] Can attacker manipulate storage to cause storage::get_borrow_rate_factors to revert, blocking all borrow rate calculations and freezing borrowing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_compounded_interest()] [DoS] If constants::seconds_per_year() can be made to revert or return invalid values, does this DoS all interest accrual across the entire protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [DoS] If oracle::get_token_price reverts for certain oracle_ids, can attacker force use of those IDs to DoS value calculations and halt liquidations/withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [DoS] Similar to calculate_value, can oracle failures be weaponized to prevent amount calculations blocking critical protocol operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: caculate_utilization()] [Rounding Attack] Can attacker maintain scale_borrow_amount and scale_supply_amount at specific ratios where ray_div rounds favorably, always getting lower utilization than reality? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_borrow_rate()] [Rounding Attack] With small utilization values, ray_mul may round to zero - can borrowers maintain tiny borrows to pay zero interest while occupying liquidity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_supply_rate()] [Rounding Attack] The nested ray_mul can compound rounding down - can suppliers engineer scenarios where they receive less interest due to precision loss accumulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_compounded_interest()] [Rounding Attack] Integer divisions by 2 and 6 in Taylor series lose precision - can borrowers structure positions to maximize this loss and underpay compound interest? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Rounding Attack] Can attacker repeatedly convert small amounts to values that round to zero, then accumulate zero-valued amounts to create value from nothing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Rounding Attack] Similar rounding issue - can attacker convert values that round to zero amounts, then use those amounts to receive actual tokens, creating tokens from nothing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: caculate_utilization()] [State Race] If total_supply and total_borrows are updated in separate transactions, can attacker transaction-order to read inconsistent state getting wrong utilization? (Medium)"
