  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call deposit() without proper authorization since it only requires &mut Staker<P> and doesn't verify caller identity, allowing unauthorized liability inflation that could drain protocol funds during claim_fees()? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call withdraw() without authorization checks, allowing them to drain SUI balance and unstake LST tokens even if they have no legitimate claim to the funds, violating custody invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Authorization Bypass] Can unauthorized parties call rebalance() to manipulate LST minting and validator stake allocation since there's no AdminCap check, potentially redirecting funds or manipulating exchange rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Authorization Bypass] Can anyone call claim_fees() to extract excess SUI without authorization, allowing theft of protocol revenue before legitimate fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Struct: Staker] [Privilege Escalation] Since AdminCap is stored inside Staker struct but only used in increase_validator_stake(), can an attacker with mutable Staker access extract or misuse the admin capability for unauthorized actions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Privilege Abuse] Does increase_validator_stake() call with U64_MAX amount give excessive control to rebalance() callers, allowing them to lock all funds in a single validator and create centralization risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Module Access] Since all mutative functions are public(package), can other modules in the suilend package call these functions without proper authorization, bypassing intended access control boundaries? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Accounting Error] Can liabilities overflow when staker.liabilities + sui.value() exceeds u64::MAX, causing wraparound to zero and breaking the liabilities >= 0 invariant, allowing unlimited withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Accounting Error] Can liabilities underflow when withdraw_amount is called with more SUI than deposited, causing staker.liabilities - sui.value() to wrap to u64::MAX and break accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Accounting Mismatch] If deposit() is called but the Balance<SUI> join fails or is partial, will liabilities be incorrectly incremented, creating a liability/balance mismatch that allows theft during withdraw()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Accounting Mismatch] If unstake_n_sui() fails to provide enough SUI (due to rounding or errors), but liabilities are still decremented by the full withdraw_amount, can this create negative real liabilities allowing over-withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Liability Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate liabilities downward before claim_fees() to increase excess_sui calculation, extracting more fees than legitimate, draining user deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Double Counting] If withdraw() is called in a loop or reentrantly, can liabilities be decremented multiple times for the same SUI, creating negative effective liabilities and enabling theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Missing Validation] Since deposit() doesn't check if sui.value() is non-zero, can it be called with zero-value deposits to manipulate state without actual fund transfer? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Liabilities Tracking] If external functions manipulate sui_balance without going through deposit()/withdraw(), will liabilities become permanently out of sync, breaking the total_sui_supply >= liabilities invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: total_sui_supply()] [Stale Data] Since total_sui_supply() can return stale data (per line 44-45 comment), can attackers exploit timing windows where actual supply differs from reported supply to manipulate exchange rates during mint/redeem? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Balance Exhaustion] If withdraw() is called for amount > sui_balance and unstake_n_sui() rounds up LST redemption, can it redeem more LST than needed, leaving staker with insufficient LST balance for future operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Balance Drain] Can rebalance() be called when sui_balance is just below MIN_DEPLOY_AMOUNT (e.g., 0.99 SUI), causing early return and preventing proper LST staking even when economically viable? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Balance Manipulation] After withdraw_all() on line 110, if mint() or increase_validator_stake() fails, is sui_balance permanently drained without LST compensation, breaking the balance invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Balance Underflow] If excess_sui calculation on lines 141-145 is called with stale total_sui_supply, can it compute excess_sui > actual available balance, causing sui_balance.split() to abort and DoS fee claiming? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [LST Balance Drain] Can repeated calls to unstake_n_sui() with rounding up drain lst_balance faster than intended, causing balance::split() to abort on line 179 when lst_balance < lst_to_redeem? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Balance Integrity] If liquid_staking::redeem() returns less SUI than expected due to slippage or fees, but unstake_n_sui() doesn't validate the output, can sui_balance become insufficient for withdraw() calls? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Rounding Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the ceiling division on lines 177-178 by requesting small sui_amount_out values repeatedly, causing rounding up to extract more LST value than their fair share? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Integer Overflow] Can the multiplication (sui_amount_out as u128) * total_lst_supply on line 178 overflow u128 when both values are large, causing incorrect lst_to_redeem calculation and fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Division by Zero] If total_sui_supply is zero when unstake_n_sui() is called, will the division on line 178 cause a panic abort, creating DoS for all withdrawals? (High)"
