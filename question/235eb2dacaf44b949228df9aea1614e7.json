  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Authorization Bypass] If an operator calls pre_vault_check() directly without going through proper operation flow, can they bypass the assert_enabled() check (commented out line 72) and manipulate vault status during disabled state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Status Manipulation] Can an attacker trigger pre_vault_check() multiple times in parallel transactions before status changes are committed, causing multiple vaults to enter DURING_OPERATION status simultaneously and breaking single-operation invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Epoch Tolerance Reset] If try_reset_tolerance() is called with false parameter at line 75, can an attacker manipulate the epoch boundary to prevent tolerance reset when it should occur, allowing accumulated losses beyond epoch limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Race Condition] Between assert_normal() check at line 73 and set_status() at line 74, can another transaction change vault status, causing two operations to both pass the check and enter DURING_OPERATION simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [DoS] Can a malicious operator repeatedly call functions that trigger pre_vault_check() to keep vault perpetually in DURING_OPERATION status, preventing legitimate deposits/withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Authorization] If assert_operator_not_freezed() only checks the freeze map but operator cap ownership isn't verified against vault ownership, can an operator from VaultA use their cap to operate on VaultB? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Asset Length Mismatch] At line 111, ERR_ASSETS_LENGTH_MISMATCH checks vector lengths match, but if defi_asset_ids contains duplicate IDs with different types, can an attacker borrow the same asset twice under different type names? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Type Confusion] Between lines 118-159, if defi_asset_type matches multiple type checks (e.g., both NaviAccountCap and Receipt have same TypeName hash), can an asset be borrowed multiple times into the Bag? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Asset Borrowing] At line 120, borrow_defi_asset() is called with parse_key result - if parse_key() returns a key that doesn't exist in vault storage, does it fail safely or can it create phantom assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Reentrancy] Between borrowing principal at line 165 and coin_type_asset at line 171, can a malicious asset's drop() or store implementation trigger reentrancy to call start_op_with_bag again? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Balance Extraction] If principal_amount at line 164 is set to vault's entire free principal, but operations fail later, is there a path where principal is never returned, locking all deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Integer Overflow] At line 178, get_total_usd_value() returns u256 - if this value is near u256::MAX and subsequent operations add to it, can it overflow and wrap to zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [State Capture] TxBagForCheckValueUpdate at lines 187-193 captures total_usd_value and total_shares - if shares are minted between start and end_op_value_update, does share verification at line 366 fail incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Event Replay] OperationStarted event at lines 195-204 contains all operation parameters - can an attacker replay this event data to confuse off-chain indexers into thinking operation succeeded? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Bag Ownership] The defi_assets Bag created at line 108 has no explicit ownership tracking - can it be passed to a different vault's end_op_with_bag() to steal assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Asset Duplication] If defi_asset_ids contains [1, 1, 2] and types are [NaviAccountCap, NaviAccountCap, CetusPosition], can the same Navi asset be added twice to the Bag at lines 123 and result in double-return? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Zero Balance Handling] Lines 164-168 and 170-176 handle zero amounts by returning balance::zero(), but is there a scenario where zero balances aren't properly destroyed in end_op, causing storage leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [ObligationType Generic] At line 132, ObligationType is a generic parameter - can an attacker specify wrong ObligationType that passes type checks but causes obligation mismatch in Suilend protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Parse Key Manipulation] vault_utils::parse_key() is called at lines 119, 127, 133, 148, 156 - if parse_key returns attacker-controlled String values, can they collide with legitimate asset keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Clock Parameter] Clock parameter at line 98 is only used for get_total_usd_value - can an attacker pass a manipulated Clock object to get incorrect snapshot value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Vault ID Mismatch] ERR_VAULT_ID_MISMATCH at line 227 checks if tx.vault_id matches - but if TxBag is created for VaultA and end_op is called on VaultB with correct vault_id manually set, does it pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Asset Not Returned] The loop at lines 231-274 calls remove() on defi_assets Bag - if an asset was never added during operation or removed by external call, does remove() panic or fail silently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Type Mismatch Return] If operator removes NaviAccountCap from Bag but returns a different NaviAccountCap not originally borrowed (with different ID), does return_defi_asset() detect the substitution? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Bag Not Empty] At line 296, destroy_empty() is called - if operator adds extra assets to the Bag during operations, can they bypass validation and inject assets into vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Balance Value Manipulation] Lines 281-283 show principal_balance.value() in event - if operator returns more principal than borrowed, does it get accepted as profit or rejected? (Medium)"
