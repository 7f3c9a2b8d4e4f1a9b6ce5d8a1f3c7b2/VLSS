  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: repay()] [Repay Amount Calculation] obligation::repay() returns repay_amount as Decimal, then ceil() is used to split coins - can ceiling cause repaying MORE than actually owed, giving free money to protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: repay()] [Partial Repayment] max_repay_coins is mut reference - what happens if repay_amount > coin::value(max_repay_coins), does it revert cleanly or leave obligation in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: fulfill_liquidity_request()] [Request Fulfillment] LiquidityRequest is consumed here - can an attacker create a request in one reserve and fulfill from different reserve by passing wrong reserve_array_index? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Liquidation Calculation] obligation::liquidate() returns (withdraw_ctoken_amount, required_repay_amount) - can rounding in required_repay_amount allow liquidator to repay LESS than debt value while receiving full collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Repay Coin Split] coin::split(repay_coins, ceil(required_repay_amount)) - if ceil() rounds up by large amount due to decimal precision, can liquidator lose excess coins without compensation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Fee Deduction] reserve::deduct_liquidation_fee() modifies ctokens balance - is protocol_fee deducted from liquidator's reward, allowing protocol to effectively steal liquidation bonus? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Health Check Timing] exist_stale_oracles is checked via assert_no_stale_oracles() - can oracle price update between this check and liquidation calculation, allowing liquidation of now-healthy position? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Reserve Borrowing] Two different borrows of reserves vector (mut then immut) - can this cause borrow checker issues if repay_reserve_array_index == withdraw_reserve_array_index? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Exemption Amount] RateLimiterExemption amount = balance::value(&ctokens) after fee deduction - does this match actual ctokens liquidator receives, or can mismatch cause redemption to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: forgive()] [Debt Forgiveness] Owner can forgive debt up to max_forgive_amount - does this reduce borrow amounts in obligation without burning ctokens from collateral, creating undercollateralized positions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: forgive()] [Reserve State] reserve::forgive_debt() updates reserve state - can this create negative available_liquidity or break reserve accounting invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: forgive()] [Bad Debt Tracking] bad_debt_usd and bad_debt_limit_usd fields are marked unused - is forgiven debt tracked anywhere to prevent unlimited forgiveness attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Reward Type Restriction] Specific hardcoded restriction on SUILEND_POINT_2 type - can an attacker mint tokens with similar but slightly different type names to bypass this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Permissionless Griefing] Anyone can call this for any obligation_id - can attacker repeatedly call this with dust rewards to spam deposits and increase gas costs for obligation owner? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Reward Routing] If expected_ctokens == 0, rewards are joined to fees - can attacker claim tiny rewards repeatedly to drain user rewards into protocol fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Borrow Repayment Logic] Checks if gt(borrowed_amount, 0) then repays - can this fail if user has multiple borrow types but rewards are only of one type, leaving partial repayment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_and_deposit()] [Deposit vs Repay Priority] Rewards are first used to repay, then deposited - can attacker manipulate this to force deposits instead of repays by frontrunning with full repayment? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_rewards_by_obligation_id()] [Reward Period Check] fail_if_reward_period_not_over flag can skip period check - does regular claim_rewards() allow claiming before period ends, breaking reward distribution model? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_reserve()] [Reserve Duplication] assert checks reserve_array_index == vector::length() to prevent duplicates - can race condition allow two add_reserve() calls to add same type if length check happens before push_back? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_reserve()] [Initial Price] reserve::create_reserve() uses price_info for initial price - can admin add reserve with manipulated initial price to enable immediate profitable borrows? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: update_reserve_config()] [Config Validation] No validation of ReserveConfig parameters - can admin set interest rates to 0 or MAX, breaking reserve economics? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: change_reserve_price_feed()] [Price Feed Change] Owner can change price feed to different PriceInfoObject - can this be exploited mid-operation to manipulate prices for liquidations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_pool_reward()] [Reward Timing] start_time_ms and end_time_ms are not validated against current clock - can admin add rewards with past time periods, causing immediate claiming? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: cancel_pool_reward()] [Reward Cancellation] Returns unallocated_rewards to caller (owner) - does this properly account for already-claimed rewards, or can owner cancel and reclaim partially-distributed rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: close_pool_reward()] [Reward Closure] Similar to cancel but called after period - can close be called before period ends via ERewardPeriodNotOver bypass to steal unclaimed rewards? (High)"
