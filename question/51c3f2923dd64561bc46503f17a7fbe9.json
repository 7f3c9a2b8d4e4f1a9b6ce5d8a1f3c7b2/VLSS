  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Partial Updates] If fee rate is added but transaction fails before completion, could table be in partial state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented test_only] [Production Use] The commented init_ is marked test_only suggesting it shouldn't be in production. Is production code using test initialization logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Assertions] No assert! statements exist for validation. Could invalid inputs pass through without checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Fee Competition] Could multiple fee tiers for similar rates enable fee competition, fragmenting liquidity and reducing capital efficiency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented Fee Values] [LP Returns] With fees of 1bp to 100bp (0.01% to 1%), could low fees discourage liquidity providers, causing pool insolvency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Momentum Position Value] Vault adaptor calculates Momentum position values. If tick_spacing affects position valuation, could wrong tick spacing cause incorrect vault share prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Liquidity Range] Tick spacing determines liquidity range granularity. Could inappropriate spacing cause vault's Momentum positions to be out-of-range, earning no fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Rebalancing Cost] Vault rebalances require closing/opening positions. Could fee rate changes force expensive rebalancing, draining vault value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: init()] [Repeated Init] Could attacker repeatedly call init() causing abort storm, degrading network performance for all users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: contains_fee_rate()] [Query DoS] Could attacker spam contains_fee_rate() with random values, each aborting and wasting validator resources? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Unbounded Growth] Table has no size limit. Could attacker add arbitrary fee rates until storage costs make GlobalConfig uneconomical to maintain? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Storage Rebate] When GlobalConfig is deleted, is storage rebate calculated correctly? Could large table cause rebate overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Object ID Exhaustion] Each GlobalConfig has unique UID. Could creating many GlobalConfig objects exhaust object ID space? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Line 37: share_object] [Consensus Impact] Shared objects affect consensus performance. Could GlobalConfig become bottleneck for protocol throughput? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Struct: GlobalConfig] [Dynamic Fields] Could GlobalConfig use dynamic fields instead of Table? Would this prevent storage DoS but enable other attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [No Integration Tests] All functions abort, suggesting no integration tests passed. Could this indicate incomplete testing leaving vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented init_] [Test vs Production] Test init and production init differ. Could production deployment use wrong initialization parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Fee Denominator] Fee rates lack explicit denominator. If assumed 1e6 but actually 1e4, fees would be 100x wrong. Where is denominator defined? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented Fee Values] [Basis Points] Values 100, 500, 3000, 10000 suggest bps (basis points) but no documentation confirms. Could misinterpretation cause 10x-100x fee errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Module: global_config] [Multi-Chain Config] If Momentum expands to other chains, could GlobalConfig desync across chains causing arbitrage opportunities? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Price Oracle] Tick spacing affects price range. Could manipulated tick spacing enable oracle price manipulation in pool pricing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [MEV Extraction] Could MEV bots monitor fee rate changes to sandwich user pool creations, extracting value from fee tier transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Function: get_tick_spacing()] [Slippage Calculation] If tick spacing is used in slippage checks, could incorrect spacing cause user transactions to fail or execute with excessive slippage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Commented Fee Values] [Too Many Tiers] Four fee tiers (100, 500, 3000, 10000 bps) could fragment liquidity across pools. Could this reduce trade execution quality? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/global_config.move] [Field: fee_amount_tick_spacing] [Similar Fee Rates] Could attacker add fee rate 101, 102, 103 near existing 100, fragmenting liquidity and reducing efficiency? (Medium)"
