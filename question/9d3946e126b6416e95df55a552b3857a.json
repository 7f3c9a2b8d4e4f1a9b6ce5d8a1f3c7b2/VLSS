[
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: unclaimed_rewards_mut()] [Direct Reward Manipulation] Since unclaimed_rewards_mut() returns mutable reference to entire Table, can malicious external code directly increase unclaimed_rewards for any reward_type, enabling attacker to claim rewards they didn't earn? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Package-Level Access] Since all state-modifying functions are public(package), can malicious sibling module in volo_vault package call these functions in incorrect order or with invalid parameters to corrupt receipt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: status()] [Public Status Exposure] Since status() is public, can external contracts read status and front-run user operations (e.g., if status shows PENDING_DEPOSIT, attacker deposits to dilute user's incoming shares)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: shares()] [Share Balance Surveillance] Can public shares() getter enable competitor vaults to track user balances and poach high-value users, or enable front-running attacks based on share holdings? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reward_indices()] [Index Surveillance] Does public(package) reward_indices() exposure enable external contracts to predict reward distributions and front-run reward claims? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_shares()] [Test Function in Production] If #[test_only] attribute is not properly enforced in production builds, can set_shares() be called to arbitrarily manipulate user's share balance, enabling direct theft of vault assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_status()] [Status Manipulation in Production] If set_status() test function is accessible in production, can attacker set status to arbitrary value bypassing all state transition logic and operation locks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_pending_withdraw_shares()] [Pending Withdrawal Forgery] If set_pending_withdraw_shares() is callable in production, can attacker set massive pending_withdraw_shares without actual request, then execute withdrawal to steal vault assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_claimable_principal()] [Claimable Principal Forgery] Can set_claimable_principal() in production allow attacker to set arbitrary claimable amount and immediately claim it, draining vault principal? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_pending_deposit_balance()] [Deposit Balance Manipulation] If set_pending_deposit_balance() is accessible, can attacker set massive pending balance without actual funds, then execute deposit receiving shares without paying? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: add_share()] [Direct Share Minting] Can add_share() test function enable attacker to mint arbitrary shares without depositing funds if test attributes are stripped in production build? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: decrease_share()] [Share Destruction Attack] Can decrease_share() be used to destroy other users' shares if test-only protection fails, enabling griefing or theft through forced share deflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: set_last_deposit_time()] [Time Lock Bypass] If set_last_deposit_time() is accessible, can attacker backdate last_deposit_time to 0 or future date to bypass withdrawal time locks in external vault logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfoUpdated] [Event Data Completeness] Does VaultReceiptInfoUpdated event only emit new_reward and unclaimed_reward without identifying reward_type or receipt_id, making it impossible for off-chain systems to track which receipt/reward was updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Missing State Change Events] Do update_after_request_deposit/withdraw/cancel/execute/claim functions emit events, or is state tracking entirely off-chain responsibility, enabling front-running by MEV bots who can read state before events? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Event Emission on Zero Reward] When new_reward_idx == *pre_idx, no event is emitted - can this cause off-chain indexers to miss receipt state updates, creating inconsistency in displayed rewards? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price Dependency] If vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() has bugs in decimal handling or overflow protection, can corrupted acc_reward value be written to unclaimed_rewards, propagating error to all reward claims? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [address::from_u256 Dependency] If address::from_u256(0) doesn't reliably produce zero address or if zero address can be represented differently, can status logic fail to correctly identify auto-transfer vs manual withdraw cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Module: vault_utils] [Parse Key Dependency] Does vault_receipt_info depend on vault_utils::parse_key for any type/ID parsing, and if so, can malformed keys cause receipt info corruption or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Share Decimal Precision] Since shares is u256 and reward_indices use u256, but claimable_principal and pending_deposit_balance are u64, can precision loss occur when converting between types, causing rounding errors that accumulate into significant fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Share Calculation Precision] If new_shares calculation in external vault uses different decimal precision than pending_deposit_balance, can users receive more/fewer shares than deserved due to unit mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Principal Calculation Precision] Does claimable_principal decimal precision match executed_withdraw_shares * vault_share_price, or can precision mismatch cause users to claim less principal than shares entitle them to? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Callback Reentrancy] If external vault code can callback into vault_receipt_info functions during deposit/withdraw execution, can reentrant calls corrupt state by modifying pending balances mid-execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Reward Update Reentrancy] If vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() can trigger callbacks, can reentrant update_reward() calls cause reward_indices to be updated multiple times in single transaction, inflating unclaimed_rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reset_unclaimed_rewards()] [Reset During Update] Can reset_unclaimed_rewards() be called while update_reward() is mid-execution, causing race condition where rewards are reset to 0 before new rewards are added, permanently losing user's earned rewards? (High)"
