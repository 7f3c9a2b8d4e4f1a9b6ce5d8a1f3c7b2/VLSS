  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: deposit_coin()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass pause checks by calling deposit_coin() directly as a friend module when storage is paused, since deposit_coin() doesn't verify pause status before calling base_deposit()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: withdraw_coin()] [Authorization Bypass] Can friend modules call withdraw_coin() to bypass pause enforcement, allowing withdrawals during emergency pause by skipping the when_not_paused check in storage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: borrow_coin()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a malicious friend module exploit borrow_coin() to extract funds when protocol is paused, since friend functions don't independently verify pause state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: repay_coin()] [Authorization Bypass] Can friend modules call repay_coin() during paused state to manipulate debt positions before unpause, bypassing intended pause restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Version Control] If storage::version_verification() fails at line 185, what happens to the already-transferred deposit_balance, and can this cause fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Version Control] Can an attacker exploit version mismatch scenarios by calling base_withdraw() after storage upgrade but before pools are migrated, causing accounting corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_borrow()] [Version Control] If version_verification at line 276 passes but internal storage structures changed, can this lead to incorrect borrow amount calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_repay()] [Version Control] Can version mismatch between storage and pool cause normal_repay_amount calculation at line 325 to use wrong conversion factors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Accounting Error] Can rounding errors in pool::normal_amount() at line 190 cause loss of precision when converting deposit_amount, allowing attackers to deposit less but receive more shares? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Accounting Error] Does the conversion from normal_withdraw_amount (line 228) to normal_withdrawable_amount (line 229-236) and back to withdrawable_amount (line 238) introduce rounding that allows users to withdraw more than deposited? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_borrow()] [Accounting Error] If pool::normal_amount() at line 278 rounds down but logic::execute_borrow() expects exact amounts, can an attacker borrow more than their collateral supports? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_repay()] [Accounting Error] Can the double conversion at lines 325 (normal_amount) and 328 (unnormal_amount) create exploitable rounding differences allowing debt to be repaid with less than owed?

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_withdraw()] [Type Confusion] Can casting normal_withdrawable_amount from u256 to u64 at line 238 cause overflow if withdrawable amount exceeds u64::MAX? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/lending.move] [Function: base_deposit()] [Precision Loss] If normal_deposit_amount at line 190 loses precision due to normalization, does this accumulated precision loss across many deposits enable share inflation attacks?
