  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a malicious friend module call version_migrate() to downgrade the version and bypass security checks added in newer versions, allowing exploitation of patched vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: version_verification()] [DoS Attack] If version::pre_check_version() reverts on version mismatch, can an attacker prevent all incentive operations by triggering version incompatibility, causing permanent DoS for reward claims and updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_incentive_v3()] [State Inconsistency] Since create_incentive_v3() only checks version::this_version() at creation time without future-proofing, can version upgrades create state inconsistencies between old Incentive objects and new validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_reward_fund()] [Access Control] create_reward_fund() is friend-only but creates a shared object - can anyone interact with the shared RewardFund after creation to manipulate balances before rules are configured? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_reward_fund()] [Accounting Error] deposit_reward_fund() joins balances without checking if reward_fund.coin_type matches actual TypeName<T> - can type confusion allow depositing wrong coin types and breaking reward distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_reward_fund()] [Fund Drainage] withdraw_reward_fund() uses std::u64::min() to cap withdrawal but is friend-only - can a compromised friend module drain all reward funds before users claim their earned rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_reward_fund()] [Insufficient Funds] If withdraw_reward_fund() is called when balance < amount, it silently withdraws less (amt) - can this create accounting mismatches where protocol expects full withdrawal but receives partial amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_reward_fund()] [Event Manipulation] RewardFundDeposited event emits amount but doesn't verify coin type - can attacker deposit dust to spam events and obscure real deposits in logs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_incentive_v3()] [Initialization Race] create_incentive_v3() creates shared object with borrow_fee_rate=0 - can attacker immediately call borrow functions before admin sets fee rate to avoid all fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Type Confusion] create_pool() checks coin_type string equality but TypeName<T> could have multiple string representations - can attacker create duplicate pools with same asset_id but different type representations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Duplicate Prevention Bypass] create_pool() uses vec_map::contains() on coin_type string, but if storage::get_coin_type() returns different string format than type_name::into_string(), can duplicates be created? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Version Check] create_pool() calls version_verification() before creating pool - if version is invalid but error occurs after pool ID is generated, is object::new() UID leaked causing resource exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Initialization Flaw] create_rule() initializes rate=0, max_rate=0, global_index=0 - can attacker create rules then immediately claim zero rewards to pollute user_total_rewards table with zero entries? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Time Manipulation] create_rule() sets last_update_at to current timestamp - if clock is manipulated to far future, then reset, can negative time deltas break index calculation in calculate_global_index()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Option Validation] create_rule() only checks option against constants::option_type_supply() and option_type_borrow() - if constants are changed or new options added, can old rules become invalid causing reverts in update functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: contains_rule()] [Performance DoS] contains_rule() iterates all rules linearly with vector::pop_back() - can attacker create many rules (high gas) to make contains_rule() extremely expensive and DoS pool/rule creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Duplicate Rules] create_rule() uses contains_rule() to check duplicates, but contains_rule() compares option+reward_coin_type - can attacker create multiple rules with same parameters by exploiting case sensitivity or Unicode in coin type strings? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: create_rule()] [Table Initialization] create_rule() creates three new Tables (user_index, user_total_rewards, user_rewards_claimed) - can repeated rule creation exhaust storage and cause DoS even if rules are later deleted? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_borrow_fee_rate()] [Rate Cap Bypass] set_borrow_fee_rate() enforces rate <= percentage_benchmark()/10 (10%) - can attacker exploit rounding in get_borrow_fee() calculation to extract more than 10% by borrowing amounts that cause favorable rounding? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_borrow_fee()] [Integer Division] get_borrow_fee() computes amount * rate / percentage_benchmark() - can attacker borrow multiple small amounts to minimize fees lost to rounding vs one large borrow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_borrow_fee()] [Fee Leakage] deposit_borrow_fee() only deposits if fee_amount > 0 - can attacker borrow amounts where calculated fee rounds to zero, avoiding all fees while still borrowing significant amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Type Confusion Attack] withdraw_borrow_fee() uses type_name::get<T>() to find fee_balance - can attacker register malicious type with same TypeName string to drain fees intended for legitimate coin type? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_borrow_fee()] [Balance Mutation] deposit_borrow_fee() mutates balance_mut directly via balance::split() - if this is called in a context where balance_mut is borrowed mutably elsewhere, can reentrancy or double-spend occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: deposit_borrow_fee()] [Bag Insertion Logic] deposit_borrow_fee() adds to Bag if not exists, else joins existing - can race condition between contains() check and borrow_mut() allow two threads to both think Bag is empty and try to add, causing panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Silent Partial Withdrawal] withdraw_borrow_fee() uses std::u64::min() to withdraw less than requested if insufficient balance - can caller assume full withdrawal succeeded and cause accounting errors in external systems? (Medium)"
