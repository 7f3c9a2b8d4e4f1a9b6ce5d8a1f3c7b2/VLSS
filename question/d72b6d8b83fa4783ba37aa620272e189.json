  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset + set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier] [Rate Timing] Can rates be set before asset creation, or must asset exist first? Can this ordering be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_incentive_v3_pool + create_incentive_v3_rule] [Pool-Rule Ordering] Must pools be created before rules, or can rules exist without pools causing dangling references? (High)",
