  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Edge Case] If queue.has_authority() returns true due to a bug when authority is set to the zero address and ctx.sender() is also zero address, can this create unauthorized access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Error Propagation] If actuate() fails after validate() succeeds, does the transaction properly revert all state changes, or can partial updates to the queue remain? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [DoS] Can a malicious authority repeatedly call run() with the same fee type T to waste gas, even though add_fee_type<T>() returns early if the type exists, causing unnecessary validation overhead? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [DoS] Can an attacker with authority flood the fee_types vector by adding thousands of unique fee types, making any operation that reads fee_types extremely expensive and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker deliberately trigger the EInvalidAuthority or EInvalidQueueVersion errors repeatedly to waste gas for legitimate users trying to interact with the queue? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Optimization] If validate() performs expensive operations (version check + authority check) but actuate() then finds the fee type already exists, can this gas waste be exploited to drain the authority's account? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vector Corruption] If the Queue module's fee_types vector can grow larger than Sui's maximum vector length, will run() cause a panic that leaves the queue in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vector Order] Can an attacker exploit the order in which fee types are added to fee_types (via push_back) to manipulate fee priority or validation logic in dependent systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Vector Access] If queue.add_fee_type<T>() doesn't properly bounds-check vector operations, can run() cause out-of-bounds access or memory corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Visibility Exploit] Since validate() is public, can an attacker call it independently to check if they have authority before attempting more expensive operations, enabling reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Visibility Exploit] Since actuate() is not public (only package-visible), can other modules in the switchboard package bypass validation by calling actuate() directly? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Entry Function] Since run() is a public entry function, can it be called from programmable transaction blocks in ways that bypass intended access controls or validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Internal Call] Can the actuate() function be called recursively through internal module logic if type parameter T triggers self-referential behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [TypeName Collision] Can type_name::get<Coin<T>>() generate colliding TypeNames for different types if module paths or package versions create ambiguity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [TypeName Format] If type_name::get<Coin<T>>() returns a TypeName with special characters or excessive length, can this break event processing or queue storage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [TypeName Manipulation] Can an attacker create a module with a carefully crafted name that makes type_name::get<Coin<T>>() return a TypeName identical to a trusted coin type? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [ID Spoofing] If queue.id() can be manipulated or doesn't match the actual object ID stored in the event, can off-chain systems be confused about which queue received the fee type? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Struct: QueueFeeTypeAdded] [ID Collision] Can two different queues have the same ID due to object creation vulnerabilities, causing the QueueFeeTypeAdded event to be ambiguous? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running] Can an attacker monitor mempool for run() transactions from the legitimate authority and front-run them to add malicious fee types first, affecting the order in fee_types vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Back-Running] After observing a successful run() transaction that adds fee type T, can an attacker immediately call a fee collection function with that newly added type before the authority intended? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Time-Based Exploit] If queue.version() or queue.has_authority() depend on time-sensitive conditions (e.g., epoch-based permissions), can an attacker exploit timing windows to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Import: switchboard::queue] [Dependency Risk] If the Queue module is upgraded to a version incompatible with queue_add_fee_coin_action, can this cause run() to fail silently or behave unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Import: sui::coin] [Dependency Risk] If the Sui framework's Coin module changes its type structure, will type_name::get<Coin<T>>() still generate correct TypeNames that match fee_types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Import: std::type_name] [Dependency Risk] If the standard library's type_name module has a vulnerability in get(), can this be exploited to inject malicious TypeNames into fee_types? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Import: sui::event] [Dependency Risk] If sui::event::emit() has a vulnerability that allows event suppression or modification, can attackers hide evidence of fee type additions?
