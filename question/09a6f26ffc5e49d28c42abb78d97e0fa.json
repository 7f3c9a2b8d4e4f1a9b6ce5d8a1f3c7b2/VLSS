  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Fee Calculation] At line 300, calculate_unstake_fee() is called on sui.value(). Can this return a fee greater than sui.value(), causing sui.split() at line 308 to panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: refresh()] [BPS Division] At line 520, (new_supply - old_supply) * reward_fee_bps / BPS_MULTIPLIER is calculated. Can reward_fee_bps = 10000 and BPS_MULTIPLIER = 10000 cause precision issues when rewards are small? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Invariant Check] At line 258, the invariant uses u128 to prevent overflow. But can the cast from u64 to u128 fail if sui_balance.value() or lst.value() are corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: collect_fees()] [Accrued Fee Subtraction] At line 370, accrued_reward_fees - reward_fees.value() is calculated. Can reward_fees.value() exceed accrued_reward_fees due to split_n_sui() errors, causing underflow? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Constant: MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT] [Minimum Enforcement] At line 31, MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT = 1_00_000_000 (0.1 SUI). Can this minimum be too high, preventing users from unstaking small remainder amounts, locking funds permanently? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Event Emission] At lines 245-249, StakeEventExt is emitted before LST is minted. Can event listeners act on this data before the transaction completes, causing off-chain state inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Event Emission] At lines 314-319, UnstakeEventExt is emitted before metadata.burn_coin(). Can the burn fail after emission, causing event data to reflect an unstake that never occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: refresh()] [Epoch Event] At lines 538-544, EpochChangedEvent is emitted. Can this event be used to front-run subsequent stake/unstake operations at the new ratio? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: collect_fees()] [Fee Event] At line 375, CollectFeesEvent only emits the amount. Can this be used to track when AdminCap is collecting fees, enabling front-running attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake_entry()] [Transfer Callback] At line 185, public_transfer() is called. If the recipient has a custom transfer hook, can it reenter stake_entry() before the current call completes? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake_entry()] [Transfer Callback] At line 277, public_transfer() of SUI occurs. Can the recipient reenter unstake_entry() to extract more SUI before validator_pool state is updated? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Metadata Mint] At line 253, metadata.mint() is called. If metadata is compromised, can it mint arbitrary LST amounts without corresponding SUI backing? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Validator Pool Split] At line 297, validator_pool.split_n_sui() is called. Can this function fail silently, returning less SUI than requested and causing user funds loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [First Stake] When both total_sui_supply and total_lst_supply are 0, line 637 returns sui_amount directly. Can an attacker stake 1 wei, then donate to validator_pool, manipulating initial ratio? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: unstake()] [Last Unstake] At line 302, when total_lst_supply == lst.value(), the last holder unstakes. Are all fees properly collected before burning the last LST, or can dust remain in the pool? (Low)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: refresh()] [Validator Refresh] At line 514, validator_pool.refresh() returns bool indicating epoch rollover. Can validator_pool maliciously return false to prevent reward distribution? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/stake_pool.move] [Function: set_validator_weights()] [Weight Application] At line 462, validator_pool.set_validator_weights() is called. Can this fail silently, causing weights to remain unchanged while emitting success event? (Medium)",
