  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] The validate() function has an empty body - can an attacker with AdminCap set an arbitrary oracle_queue_id (including zero address 0x0, non-existent queue, or malicious queue) without any validation checks, breaking oracle integrity assumptions throughout the Volo system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Input Validation Missing] Since validate() performs no checks, can an admin accidentally or maliciously set oracle_queue_id to the zero address (0x0000...0000), causing all oracle price queries in volo-vault to fail or return incorrect prices, leading to vault operation failures and loss calculation errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [State Corruption] The empty validate() allows setting oracle_queue_id without verifying the Queue object exists - can an attacker set a deleted or non-existent queue ID, causing all downstream oracle reads in vault operations to abort with 'object not found' errors, permanently DoSing the vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Manipulation] With no validation, can a compromised admin set oracle_queue_id to point to a malicious Queue they control with fake oracles, allowing manipulation of all Switchboard price feeds used by volo-vault for USD valuation, enabling theft through inflated asset prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Circular Reference] Can validate() be exploited by setting oracle_queue_id to reference a Queue that itself references this State object in a circular dependency, causing infinite loops or stack overflows in oracle resolution paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] Does the missing validation allow setting oracle_queue_id to a Queue from an incompatible Switchboard version with different schema/API, causing all vault oracle calls to fail with type mismatches or missing method errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Unauthorized Queue Type] Since validate() checks nothing, can oracle_queue_id be set to a guardian_queue ID instead of an oracle queue, breaking the type assumption and causing incorrect behavior when vault operations query oracle prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Reorg Attack] Without validation of queue ownership or permissions, can oracle_queue_id be set to a Queue owned by an external party who can later destroy or modify the Queue, causing vault oracle failures mid-operation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Resource Exhaustion] Can the empty validate() be abused to set oracle_queue_id to a Queue with thousands of registered oracles, causing excessive gas consumption or timeouts when vault operations iterate through oracle feeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Same ID Set] Does validate() prevent setting oracle_queue_id to the same value it already has? Can repeated calls with identical IDs be used to spam OracleQueueIdSet events to bloat event logs or confuse off-chain indexers tracking oracle changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Confusion] Without validation, if oracle_queue_id is set to the same ID as guardian_queue in State, does this create ambiguity in oracle vs guardian resolution logic, potentially bypassing guardian attestation requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Attestation Bypass] Can validate() be exploited by setting oracle_queue_id to a Queue with min_attestations=0, allowing single-oracle price manipulation without requiring consensus from multiple oracles? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Stale Queue] Does the missing validation allow setting oracle_queue_id to a Queue that hasn't been updated in months/years, with all oracles offline or with stale prices, breaking volo-vault's price freshness assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Cross-Chain Queue] Can oracle_queue_id be set to reference a Queue object from a different blockchain/network (if Sui supports cross-chain objects), causing type incompatibilities or network-specific failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Fee Configuration] Without validation of Queue fee structures, can oracle_queue_id be set to a Queue with excessive oracle query fees that drain vault gas budgets or make price updates economically infeasible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Capability Bypass] The run() function only checks for AdminCap presence via reference - can an attacker who temporarily borrows AdminCap (e.g., through a flash loan pattern or composability exploit) call this function to change oracle_queue_id maliciously? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [AdminCap Theft] If AdminCap is transferred to a contract with a vulnerability allowing reentrancy, can an attacker use the reentrant call to invoke run() during the same transaction where AdminCap was supposed to be safely held? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multiple AdminCaps] Does the system allow multiple AdminCap objects to exist? If so, can a compromised or rogue admin with one AdminCap change oracle_queue_id to interfere with legitimate admin operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [AdminCap Wrapping] Can AdminCap be wrapped in another object that still allows passing it by reference to run(), bypassing intended access control patterns that check for direct AdminCap ownership? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Time-Based Attack] If AdminCap is expected to be revoked or transferred at a certain time but the transaction is delayed, can run() be called during a vulnerable time window to set a malicious oracle_queue_id before admin rights are properly transferred? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Batch Transaction Exploit] Can run() be called multiple times in a single batch transaction (if Sui supports transaction batching) to rapidly change oracle_queue_id, causing oracle resolution to use inconsistent queue IDs across different operations in the same block? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Emergency Pause Missing] Does run() lack an emergency pause mechanism? Can a compromised admin continue changing oracle_queue_id even when the system should be frozen for security incident response? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [AdminCap Destruction] If AdminCap can be destroyed or burned, does run() fail gracefully, or could partial destruction leave the system in an inconsistent state where oracle_queue_id was changed but the admin role is unclear? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Inheritance Exploitation] If another contract inherits or composes this module, can it expose run() without proper AdminCap checks, allowing unauthorized oracle_queue_id changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Module Call] Can run() be called from another module's public function that doesn't properly validate AdminCap, effectively bypassing the authorization check through module composition?
