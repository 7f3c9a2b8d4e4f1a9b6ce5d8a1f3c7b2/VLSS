  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Constant: MIN_DEPLOY_AMOUNT] [Economic Attack] Can the 1 SUI minimum on line 20 be exploited to prevent rebalancing by maintaining exactly 0.999 SUI in sui_balance, causing yield loss? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Fee Theft] Can claim_fees() be front-run by deposit() calls that inflate liabilities, reducing excess_sui and stealing fees from legitimate claimants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Fee Manipulation] Can an attacker call withdraw() just before claim_fees() to decrease total_sui_supply, causing excess_sui calculation to show negative or zero fees when fees should exist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Buffer Manipulation] Does the MIST_PER_SUI (1 SUI) buffer on line 141 allow up to 1 SUI of fees to remain unclaimed indefinitely, creating permanent fee leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Unstake Rounding] When unstake_n_sui() rounds up LST redemption for fee claiming, can repeated fee claims slowly drain more LST than the actual fee amount justifies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Race Condition] Between computing excess_sui on line 141 and splitting it on line 152, if another transaction deposits funds, can the split fail or extract more than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Unstake Failure] If unstake_n_sui() on line 149 silently fails or returns 0 SUI, will claim_fees() still attempt to split excess_sui, causing an abort and DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Invariant Check Timing] Is the invariant check on line 154 performed after splitting fees but before returning them, creating a window where funds are extracted but invariant appears satisfied? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Conditional Logic] Can an attacker exploit the condition on line 88 by requesting withdraw_amount == sui_balance to skip unstaking, then frontrun to drain sui_balance causing the next withdrawal to fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Unstake Amount] On line 89, if sui_balance.value() changes between the check on line 88 and the subtraction on line 89, can unstake_amount be incorrectly calculated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Split Failure] If unstake_n_sui() provides less SUI than expected and sui_balance.split(withdraw_amount) is called on line 93, will the transaction abort, causing DoS for withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Liability Decrement] Does line 94 decrement liabilities by sui.value() which might be less than withdraw_amount if split() fails partially, creating accounting mismatch? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Reentrancy] Can withdraw() be called reentrantly through liquid_staking::redeem() callback, allowing double withdrawal before liabilities are decremented? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Zero Amount] When unstake_n_sui() early returns on line 170 for sui_amount_out == 0, does this allow withdraw(0) calls to pass through without proper accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Supply Fetch] Are total_sui_supply and total_lst_supply on lines 173-174 fetched without fresh refresh(), allowing stale ratio calculations during unstaking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [MEV Attack] Can MEV bots sandwich withdraw() calls by front-running with rebalance() to manipulate exchange rates, extracting value from legitimate withdrawers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [Supply Check] Does the assertion on line 58 checking coin::total_supply(&treasury_cap) == 0 prevent malicious initialization with pre-minted LST tokens that could dilute future minters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [Fee Config] Can the fee_config created on line 61 be maliciously configured to extract excessive fees since fees::new_builder(ctx).to_fee_config() is used without validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [Admin Cap Storage] Is storing AdminCap inside Staker struct on line 67 a security risk, as it could be extracted by unauthorized code with access to &mut Staker? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [Initial State] Since Staker is initialized with zero balances and liabilities on lines 69-71, can early deposits before first rebalance() create incorrect exchange rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: create_staker()] [TreasuryCap Consumption] After liquid_staking::create_lst() consumes the treasury_cap, can the original creator still mint tokens through other pathways, breaking the supply guarantee? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Constant: SUILEND_VALIDATOR] [Centralization] Does hardcoding SUILEND_VALIDATOR address on lines 16-17 create a single point of failure where validator slashing or downtime impacts all staked funds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Validator Change] Can the SUILEND_VALIDATOR address be updated, or is it permanently fixed, preventing migration if the validator becomes compromised or performs poorly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Validator Validation] Does increase_validator_stake() validate that SUILEND_VALIDATOR is active and not jailed/slashed before delegating funds, or can funds be staked to inactive validator? (High)",
