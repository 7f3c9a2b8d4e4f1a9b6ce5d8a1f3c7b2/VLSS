  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_collateral_balance()] [Stale Index Risk] Uses current supply_index without update - can stale index cause incorrect balance calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_loan_balance()] [Borrow Index Timing] Uses borrow_index from storage - if index not updated, can return incorrect loan balance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: user_loan_balance()] [Interest Calculation] Multiplies scaled balance by index to include interest - can attacker avoid interest by preventing index updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: is_collateral()] [Vector Contains Performance] Uses vector::contains which is O(n) - can attacker create many collateral entries to DoS this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: is_loan()] [List Manipulation] Checks if asset in loans list - can list be corrupted causing incorrect loan tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Liquidation Ratio Manipulation] liquidation_ratio from storage - can attacker manipulate ratio configuration to maximize liquidation bonus? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Liquidation Bonus Exploit] liquidation_bonus applied to liquidable_value - can attacker trigger liquidation with inflated bonus values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Treasury Factor Application] treasury_factor applied to bonus - can low treasury_factor allow liquidator to extract more value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Excess Value Calculation] Complex logic for excess_value with multiple conditionals - can edge cases in conditions be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Liquidable Value Caps] liquidable_value capped by liquidation_ratio - can attacker liquidate in multiple small transactions to bypass cap? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Oracle Price Consistency] Multiple oracle calls for different assets - can prices change between calls causing inconsistent liquidation calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Max Loan Value Flag] is_max_loan_value determines loan removal - can attacker manipulate to avoid full loan clearance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Repay Amount Overflow] If repay_amount near u256::MAX, can repay_value calculation overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Collateral Amount Conversion] calculate_amount converts values to amounts - can rounding cause liquidator to receive less collateral than calculated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_liquidation()] [Executor Bonus Rounding] executor_bonus_value = total_bonus_value - treasury_value - can rounding cause executor to receive more than intended? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_avg_ltv()] [Division by Zero] If total_value is 0, returns 0 - can this cause issues in borrow health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: calculate_avg_ltv()] [LTV Weighting Manipulation] LTV weighted by collateral value - can attacker deposit high-LTV assets to inflate average? (High)",
