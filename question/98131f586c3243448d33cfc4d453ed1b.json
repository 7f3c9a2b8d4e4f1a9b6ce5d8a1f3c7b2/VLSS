  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Upgrade Timing] If constants::version() is updated at block N but oracle objects are migrated at block N+100, can 100 blocks of failed transactions occur due to version mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Transaction Ordering] Can an attacker order transactions to call pre_check_version() before admin migration completes, front-running legitimate users and causing their transactions to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Epoch Boundary] If protocol upgrades during epoch rollover in Sui, can version checks interfere with epoch transition logic causing validator rewards to be miscalculated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [No Version History] Since there's no version history tracking, can administrators lose visibility into which oracle objects are on which versions during multi-stage rollouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [No Migration Helper] Is there a batch migration function, or must each oracle/config be migrated individually, increasing risk of inconsistent version states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [No Version Validation] Is there validation that oracle.version <= this_version(), or can oracle objects have future version numbers breaking assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [DoS Attack] Can an attacker create many oracle objects on v1, then when protocol upgrades to v2, all those v1 oracles become unusable until individually migrated, causing mass DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Migration Front-run] Can an attacker monitor for oracle_version_migrate() transactions and front-run with malicious pre_check_version() calls to block migration? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Version Confusion] Can external protocols integrating with Volo get confused between oracle version (2) and lending protocol version, causing incorrect integration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Unused Path] Since next_version() is only used in incentive_v2.move once, can removing this function break that single caller, and is there test coverage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Zero Version] If constants::version() were changed to 0, would next_version() returning 1 break any assumptions that version starts from 1 or 2? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Equality Check] Does the strict equality check (v == version) prevent compatible minor version increments, or should it use >= to allow backward compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Init Order] If oracle_version module is published after oracle module, can initialization fail because oracle.move's init function uses this_version()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Upgrade Order] During upgrade, if oracle_version is upgraded before oracle/config modules, can the version number jump cause existing objects to become inaccessible? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Dependency Resolution] Can Move VM dependency resolution order cause oracle_version to be initialized with wrong dependencies if modules are published in wrong order? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Vault Oracle Sync] Can volo-vault's oracle dependency version (2) be out of sync with vault's own versioning, causing price feed failures during vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Health Limiter Impact] If oracle version check fails during health_limiter's Navi health factor validation, can critical liquidation operations be blocked causing bad debt? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Price Feed Staleness] Can version mismatch in oracle prevent price updates, causing vault to use stale prices for loss_tolerance calculation and allowing excessive losses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Adaptor Impact] Can oracle version issues prevent volo-vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus, Momentum) from getting price feeds, blocking all DeFi operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Request Buffer Impact] If oracle version mismatch blocks price updates during deposit/withdrawal request processing, can users be unable to complete requests within locking windows? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Reward Calculation Impact] Can version issues in oracle affect vault reward calculations by preventing accurate USD value snapshots needed for pre/post operation comparison? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Cross-Protocol Risk] If multiple protocols (Volo vault, Volo LST, external integrators) all depend on this oracle version module, can a version upgrade cause cascading failures across entire ecosystem? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Composability Break] Can oracle version incompatibility break composability where external protocols expect stable oracle interface but get version errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_version.move] [All Functions] [Governance Risk] If protocol governance can change constants::version() without upgrading module code, can malicious governance instantly brick all oracle functionality? (Critical)"
