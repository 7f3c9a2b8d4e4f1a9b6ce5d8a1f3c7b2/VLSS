  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: new()] [Initialization Safety] Could the Cell::new() function be called with a critical asset (like vault capabilities or admin caps) that should never be wrapped in an optional container, enabling unintended None states in calling code? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: new()] [Type Safety] If Cell::new() is used to wrap borrowed capabilities or references, could the generic Element type parameter allow storing short-lived borrows that outlive their source, causing use-after-free scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [State Consistency] In Cell::set(), the option::swap() operation returns the old element without any validation - could this allow extracting critical elements (like operator caps) from cells mid-operation before proper authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [Reentrancy] If Cell::set() is called during a vault operation that temporarily stores an asset in a Cell, could an attacker exploit the swap timing to extract the asset before the operation completes, violating the custody invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [Authorization Bypass] Could Cell::set() be used to replace an admin capability stored in a Cell without proper authorization checks in the calling context, if the calling module doesn't verify the caller before allowing set() operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Borrow Safety] The Cell::get() function uses option::borrow() which assumes Some - if calling code doesn't ensure the Cell contains an element, could this cause aborts that enable DoS attacks on critical vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Reference Lifetime] Does Cell::get() returning &Element allow creating long-lived references to mutable state that should be short-lived, enabling TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) attacks where the element is modified between borrow and use? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Concurrent Access] If multiple parts of vault code call Cell::get() on the same cell containing oracle price data, could concurrent reads during price updates create race conditions where some operations see stale prices while others see updated prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: destroy()] [Invariant Violation] Cell::destroy() calls option::destroy_some() which aborts if element is None - could this be exploited to DoS vault operations if an attacker can empty a Cell via set() before a critical destroy() call? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: destroy()] [Resource Leak] If Cell::destroy() is called on a Cell containing a capability that should be preserved (like an adaptor account cap), does the calling code ensure proper handling of the returned element, or could it be silently dropped causing resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: destroy()] [Asset Custody] If vault adaptors use Cell::destroy() to extract borrowed DeFi assets (Navi positions, Suilend obligations), could the lack of balance checks in destroy() allow assets to be extracted without corresponding return tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Struct: Cell<Element>] [Generic Type Abuse] Could the generic Element type parameter be instantiated with types that violate Move's ability constraints (like types without store ability) in ways that bypass safety checks when integrated with vault accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Struct: Cell<Element>] [Storage Model] Since Cell has store ability, could Cells containing critical vault state be transferred or stored in user-controlled objects, breaking encapsulation and allowing unauthorized state manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Module Design] [Encapsulation] The module provides no access control - if vault modules use Cell to store admin capabilities or operator freeze states, could the public API allow any caller to manipulate these cells? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] [Vault Accounting] If Cells are used to temporarily store share amounts or fee calculations during vault operations, could the lack of validation in set()/get()/destroy() allow accounting corruption if elements are swapped mid-calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] [Oracle Price Storage] If vault adaptors store Switchboard oracle prices in Cells for caching, does the lack of staleness checks in Cell operations allow using outdated prices after a set() operation replaces them? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] [Request Buffer] If deposit/withdrawal request buffers use Cells to store pending requests, could direct Cell::set() calls bypass request validation logic and corrupt the buffer state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] [Adaptor Assets] If Navi/Suilend/Cetus adaptors use Cells to temporarily hold borrowed protocol assets during operations, could Cell::destroy() be called prematurely before the asset is properly returned, breaking the borrow/return invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] [Health Limiter] If health factor verification results are stored in Cells, could Cell::set() be used to replace a failed health check result with a passing one, bypassing safety limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [Panic Safety] If option::swap() can panic under certain type conditions, could an attacker craft Element types that cause set() to abort at critical moments, freezing vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Immutability Assumptions] Does code calling Cell::get() assume the returned reference remains valid and unchanged, when concurrent set() operations could invalidate that assumption in complex vault operation sequences? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Module Design] [Missing Validation] The module provides no pre/post-condition checks - if integrated into vault operations that require atomic state transitions, could Cell operations break atomicity guarantees? (High)"
