  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Partial Export Strategy] Multiple calls to export_stakes() with max_iterations batching could lead to inconsistent snapshots if validator balances change between calls. (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Fee Calculation] collected_rewards is used directly as fee_amount at line 145, but this doesn't account for potential accrued fees during export_stakes() batching. (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Import Strategy] Why is import_amount a parameter instead of automatically importing all remaining balance from migration_storage? This adds complexity and potential for error. (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: destroy_migration_cap()] [Finalization Check] The function checks exported_count but not imported_count - how do we verify all exported stakes were actually imported? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Empty Native Pool] If NativePool has no staked SUI, exported_sui could be zero balance, but the function still proceeds - should this be allowed? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Zero Import with Rebalance] If import_amount = 0 due to empty migration_storage, rebalance() still executes - could this redistribute stakes incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: deposit_sui()] [Depositing During Migration] deposit_sui() can be called at any point during migration - what if it's called after destroy_migration_cap()? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Overall Flow] [Non-Atomic Migration] The entire migration is split across multiple function calls - could the chain state change between calls causing inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Epoch Transitions] If an epoch transition happens during export_stakes() execution, could validator rewards be distributed inconsistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [System State Race] SuiSystemState is accessed during rebalance - if another transaction modifies it concurrently, could import stakes to wrong validators? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Balance Type] Balance<SUI> is created at line 79 - is there any validation that this is the correct coin type for the network? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Balance Compatibility] exported_sui from export_stakes_from_v1 is joined to sui_balance - are these guaranteed to be the same SUI type? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Coin Conversion] Line 147 converts Balance to Coin via into_coin(ctx) - is there any precision loss in this conversion? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [LST Supply] Metadata<CERT> is passed to import operations - does importing stakes mint new LST tokens? If so, to whom? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Supply Inflation] If rebalance() mints LST tokens during migration, could this dilute existing V2 holders if migration happens slowly? (High)"
