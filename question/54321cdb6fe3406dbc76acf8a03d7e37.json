  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_linear_interest()] [Edge Case] When timestamp_difference is 0, the function returns ray() + 0 = ray() (1.0x multiplier) correctly - but is there any check that timestamp_difference is actually the difference between current and last timestamp and not negative? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_linear_interest()] [Missing Validation] No validation that rate is in reasonable bounds or matches the expected rate precision (RAY) - can mismatched rate units cause 1000x or 0.001x interest errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_linear_interest()] [Formula Correctness] Linear interest formula is simple ray() + rate * time / year - but if rate is annual and not adjusted to per-second, does this double-count the time conversion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_linear_interest()] [Comparison to Compound] This function is simpler than calculate_compounded_interest but may be used interchangeably - can an attacker force use of linear instead of compound to underpay interest in long-term positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] The function asserts is_valid but doesn't check price freshness or staleness - can an attacker use stale oracle prices to convert amounts at incorrect values for profit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Division by Zero] If decimal is so large that sui::math::pow(10, decimal) overflows or if it equals 0, will the division amount * price / pow(...) fail or produce incorrect values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Integer Overflow] When amount * price overflows u256 before dividing by the decimal adjustment, does this cause wrapped values enabling attackers to report tiny values for huge amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Precision Loss] The division amount * price / pow(10, decimal) truncates - with small amounts or large decimals, does this round down to zero incorrectly reporting no value for non-zero amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Price Manipulation] If an attacker can front-run oracle updates or manipulate the PriceOracle object, can they pass inflated/deflated prices to convert amounts at wrong values for liquidation or collateral manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Decimal Mismatch] If oracle decimal doesn't match the asset's actual decimals, the conversion is wrong - is there validation that oracle_id corresponds to the correct asset with matching decimals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Oracle ID Manipulation] If an attacker can pass wrong oracle_id for an asset, can they use a different asset's price (e.g., using BTC price for USD) to massively misvalue amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [U8 Overflow] The oracle_id is u8 (max 255) - is there validation that it's within valid oracle ID range, or can overflow/invalid IDs cause unexpected oracle behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Missing Bounds Check] There's no check that the calculated value is reasonable (e.g., not > protocol TVL) - can overflow or manipulation cause nonsensical values that break downstream calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_value()] [Price Zero] If oracle returns price = 0 (due to malfunction or manipulation), amount * 0 / pow = 0 incorrectly valuing all amounts as worthless - should there be a minimum price check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Division by Zero] If oracle returns price = 0, the division value * pow / 0 fails causing DoS - can oracle manipulation force zero prices to halt amount calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Integer Overflow] When value * sui::math::pow(10, decimal) overflows u256 before dividing by price, does this cause wrapped amounts enabling attackers to receive massive token amounts for small values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Precision Loss] The division value * pow(10, decimal) / price truncates - with small values or low prices, does this round down to zero incorrectly returning zero amount for non-zero value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Oracle Manipulation] Like calculate_value, this trusts is_valid but not freshness - can stale prices enable attackers to convert values to amounts at outdated rates for arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Price Manipulation] If an attacker can temporarily deflate price in the oracle, value * pow / tiny_price returns huge amount, enabling them to extract more tokens than their value justifies? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Decimal Mismatch] Similar to calculate_value, if oracle decimal doesn't match asset decimals, the conversion is systematically wrong - is there enforcement of correct oracle_id usage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Oracle ID Manipulation] Can an attacker pass wrong oracle_id to use incorrect asset prices (e.g., using cheap asset price to calculate amount for expensive asset) and drain funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Inverse Relationship] This function is inverse of calculate_value - is there validation that amount = calculate_amount(calculate_value(amount)) to prevent rounding exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Missing Bounds Check] No validation that calculated amount is reasonable - can overflow or manipulation produce amounts exceeding total asset supply enabling minting attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Function: calculate_amount()] [Price Spike] If price temporarily spikes to u256::MAX, the division value * pow / huge_price rounds to zero or tiny amount - can this be exploited during flash price manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/calculator.move] [Integration: caculate_utilization + calculate_borrow_rate] [Stale Data] If storage is updated between these two function calls, can inconsistent utilization cause borrow rate calculation to use wrong parameters, enabling rate arbitrage? (Medium)"
