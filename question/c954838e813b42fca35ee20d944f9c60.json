  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] If the same guardian_queue_id is set multiple times (no validation prevents this), will multiple identical GuardianQueueIdSet events be emitted, confusing off-chain monitoring and creating false alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy via Validate] Although validate() is currently empty, if it's implemented in the future to call external contracts, could a malicious contract reenter run() and change guardian_queue_id multiple times in a single transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Reentrancy via Event] If event::emit() triggers any hooks or callbacks (unlikely in Sui but theoretically possible), could actuate() be reentered, causing guardian_queue_id to be set multiple times with different values in the same transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Atomicity] If on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id() fails (e.g., due to package visibility issues), will the transaction abort cleanly, or could partial state changes occur leaving the system in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [DoS via Invalid ID] Can an attacker with compromised AdminCap set guardian_queue_id to an invalid or deleted object ID, causing all guardian-dependent oracle operations (price updates, attestations) to fail, effectively DoSing the entire oracle system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [DoS via Rapid Changes] Can AdminCap holder call run() repeatedly in quick succession, changing guardian_queue_id multiple times per epoch, causing off-chain guardian nodes to desync or miss configuration updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spam DoS] Since there's no rate limiting or cooldown, can an admin spam run() calls with alternating guardian_queue_id values, flooding the event log and causing DoS for off-chain indexers/monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] If guardian_queue_id is changed frequently, will guardian nodes waste gas constantly updating their local state, or could this be used to grief guardians by forcing constant config reloads? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [on_demand Module Dependency] The actuate() function calls on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id without error handling - if that function panics or fails, will the entire transaction abort with no fallback or recovery mechanism? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Package Visibility Risk] on_demand::set_guardian_queue_id has package visibility - if the on_demand module is upgraded or modified, could set_guardian_queue_id_action lose access to this function, breaking guardian queue updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Object Contention] State is a shared object - can concurrent transactions calling run() and other state-modifying functions cause transaction conflicts, preventing guardian_queue_id updates during high oracle activity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Queue Consistency] If guardian_queue_id is changed while guardians are actively processing oracle updates using the old queue, will those updates fail validation, or could attestations be applied to the wrong queue causing data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Volo Vault Oracle Dependency] If Volo Vault depends on guardian-attested oracle prices and guardian_queue_id is changed to a malicious queue, can fake price attestations bypass health checks, enabling vault manipulation or unsafe operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Rollback Mechanism] If guardian_queue_id is set to a bad value (deleted object, malicious queue), is there any emergency rollback or revert function, or does it require a full contract upgrade to fix? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Emergency Stop] There's no emergency pause or circuit breaker - if guardian_queue_id change causes cascading oracle failures, can the admin quickly halt guardian operations while fixing the issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Lost AdminCap Recovery] If AdminCap is lost or the admin's key is compromised and guardian_queue_id is set maliciously, is there any recovery mechanism to restore proper guardian queue configuration without admin access? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Historical State Loss] If guardian_queue_id is changed, is the history of previous guardian queue IDs preserved anywhere for audit trails, or is old_guardian_queue_id only in the event log (which could be lost if not indexed)? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Initialization State] Can run() be called when State.guardian_queue is still the zero address from init(), setting guardian_queue_id for the first time - and if so, should this have different validation than subsequent updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Same-Block Multiple Calls] If run() is called multiple times in the same block/transaction with different guardian_queue_id values, will only the last value persist, and will all intermediate GuardianQueueIdSet events still be emitted creating confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Old Queue Cleanup] When guardian_queue_id is changed, is there any cleanup or notification to the old guardian queue that it's no longer the active queue, or could old guardians continue operating unaware of the change? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Set Migration] If the new guardian_queue has a completely different set of guardians than the old queue, could this create a security gap where attestations from new guardians aren't yet trusted by dependent systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Future Implementation Risk] The validate() function is explicitly defined but empty - if it's meant to be implemented later, could the current no-validation state be exploited before the implementation is complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Time-Lock] Critical guardian queue changes have no time-lock or delay period - can a compromised admin immediately switch to a malicious queue before the community can react or trigger emergency procedures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Multi-Sig] There's no multi-signature requirement for guardian_queue_id changes - can a single compromised admin unilaterally change this critical security parameter without any co-signer validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_guardian_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Governance Vote] Critical parameter changes don't require governance vote or community approval - can the admin change guardian_queue_id arbitrarily, potentially favoring certain oracle providers or manipulating oracle outcomes? (Medium)"
