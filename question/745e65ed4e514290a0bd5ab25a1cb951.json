  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Cap Transfer Security] MigrationCap is transferred to ctx.sender() at line 90 - if sender is a malicious contract, could it control migration? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: destroy_migration_cap()] [Cap Destruction Timing] destroy_migration_cap() consumes the cap but what prevents calling it multiple times if multiple caps were created? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Struct: MigrationCap] [Key Store Abilities] MigrationCap has 'key, store' abilities at line 59 - does 'store' allow it to be placed in other objects, potentially creating custody issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Pause State] native_pool.set_pause(owner_cap, true) at line 75 pauses the pool, but is there validation that the pool wasn't already paused? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Validator Set Corruption] If export_stakes_from_v1() at line 113 fails mid-iteration, is validator_set left in an inconsistent state that breaks NativePool? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: take_unclaimed_fees()] [Rewards Reset] Setting *unclaimed_fees = 0 at line 148 zeroes out protocol rewards - is there any way to recover if this amount was incorrect? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Join vs Stake] join_to_sui_pool() at line 173 adds liquid SUI - does this differ from staking, and could it bypass validator selection logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Metadata Mutation] Metadata<CERT> is passed mutably at line 163 - if rebalance() at line 174 modifies metadata incorrectly, does this corrupt LST supply? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Pool Initialization] stake_pool::create_stake_pool() is called at line 100 - does this create the pool with correct initial parameters matching V1? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: deposit_sui()] [Unauthorized Deposits] deposit_sui() at lines 203-218 allows adding SUI to migration_storage - could this be used to prevent cap destruction by keeping balance > 0? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Export Duplication] If export_stakes() is called multiple times, balances accumulate at line 116 - could this double-count stakes if validator_set isn't properly cleaned? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Partial Import] Using min() at line 169 allows partial imports - if remaining balance is small, it could be trapped forever below minimum thresholds. (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Assert Error Code] Line 98 uses error code 0 - are error codes properly documented and unique across the module? (Low)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Ratio Assert] Line 179 uses error code 0 for ratio check - does this conflict with other error code 0 uses? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: export_stakes()] [Gas Griefing] export_stakes() with very high max_iterations at line 109 could consume excessive gas - is there an upper bound? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: import_stakes()] [Rebalance Gas] rebalance() at line 174 could be gas-intensive with many validators - could this cause import to fail due to gas limits? (Medium)",
