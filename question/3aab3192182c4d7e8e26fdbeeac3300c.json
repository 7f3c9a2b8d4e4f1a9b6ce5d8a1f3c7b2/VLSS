Could this enable fee griefing where attackers cause valid updates to fail while consuming fees? (High)",

Could extreme value magnitudes cause precision loss or rounding errors affecting price accuracy in dependent vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: run()] [Negative Price Manipulation] Line 137 accepts neg bool allowing negative prices. For asset prices that should never be negative (e.g., SUI price), could attacker submit neg=true causing vault calculations to underflow or produce invalid results? (Critical)",

Could u128::MAX value cause overflows in subsequent decimal math operations in vault price calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Value Variance Bypass] Line 77 includes aggregator.max_variance() in update_msg but doesn't validate submitted value against variance bounds. Could attacker submit price far outside variance causing downstream vault losses? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Min Responses Bypass] Line 78 includes aggregator.min_responses() in update_msg but doesn't check if min_responses threshold is met. Could single oracle update when min_responses=5 cause single point of failure in price feeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Result Ordering] Line 112-117 calls aggregator.add_result() which may aggregate multiple oracle results. If results arrive out-of-order by timestamp, could older results override newer ones causing stale price acceptance? (High)",

If transaction reverts after emit, could observers see false update events causing off-chain systems to act on invalid data? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_submit_result_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Ordering] Lines 134-142 list 9 parameters.

Could blockchain state change between calls (e.g., oracle expiration, queue modification) causing validated data to become invalid during actuation? (High)",
