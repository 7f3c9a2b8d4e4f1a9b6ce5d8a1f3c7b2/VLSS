  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: momentum_adaptor] [Sandwich Attack Risk] If position value calculation uses real-time pool price (sqrt_price), could attackers sandwich vault value update transactions to manipulate prices and steal funds via inflated valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: liquidity()] [Get Amounts Risk] If liquidity value is used in liquidity_math::get_amounts_for_liquidity() without validating tick range, could out-of-range ticks cause sqrt_price calculations to panic or return incorrect amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: tick_lower_index(), tick_upper_index()] [Tick Spacing Risk] If tick indices don't align with pool's tick_spacing, could this cause position operations to fail or liquidity to be added at wrong price points? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: PositionRewardInfo] [Reward Index Risk] If reward_infos vector indices don't correspond to pool's reward token indices, could reward claims retrieve wrong tokens or amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: coins_owed_reward()] [Stale Reward Risk] If coins_owed_reward returns cached value not updated when pool reward rates change, could users claim less rewards than entitled, or claim excess rewards from outdated calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: reward_growth_inside_last()] [Growth Rate Risk] If reward_growth_inside_last can be set to future values exceeding actual growth, could users claim rewards before they accrue, draining pool reserves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Zero Liquidity Position Risk] If Position objects can exist with zero liquidity but non-zero owed fees/rewards, could this cause division-by-zero errors in per-liquidity reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Full Range Position Risk] If tick_lower is MIN_TICK and tick_upper is MAX_TICK, could full-range positions bypass certain pool checks or cause overflow in tick range calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: fee_rate()] [Fee Rate Change Risk] If fee_rate can change mid-position lifetime (e.g., pool fee tier changes), could this cause fee calculations to use incorrect rates, over/under charging fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: PositionRewardInfo] [Empty Reward Vector Risk] If reward_infos vector is empty but pool has active rewards, could this prevent position from earning rewards, causing loss to vault depositors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: is_empty()] [Early Position Close Risk] If is_empty() is used to gate position closure but only checks liquidity, could positions with unclaimed fees be closed early, losing fees? (Medium)"
