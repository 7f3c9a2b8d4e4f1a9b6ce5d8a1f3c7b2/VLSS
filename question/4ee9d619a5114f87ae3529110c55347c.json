(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Key Curve Validation] Does run() at line 77 validate that secp256k1_key is a valid point on the secp256k1 curve, or can invalid curve points be accepted causing signature verification to fail or behave unexpectedly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Enclave Measurement Trust] Does mr_enclave at line 56 need to be on an allowlist of trusted measurements, or can any enclave measurement be accepted, allowing malicious enclave code to provide oracle data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Public Key Compression] If secp256k1_key at line 77 can be either compressed (33 bytes) or uncompressed (65 bytes), does downstream signature verification handle both formats, or could format mismatch cause verification failures? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Key-Enclave Consistency] Is there any validation that secp256k1_key and mr_enclave at lines 55-56 match (i.e., key was generated within that specific enclave), or can mismatched key-enclave pairs be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Key Consistency] Does validate() at line 40 ensure queue_key is cryptographically bound to queue identity, or can queue_key be arbitrary values enabling queue impersonation?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp Precision] Does clock.timestamp_ms() at line 60 have sufficient precision to prevent timestamp collisions when multiple overrides occur in same block, potentially overwriting each other's timestamps?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Capability Required] Since run() at line 74 only checks queue authority via has_authority(), could more fine-grained capabilities (e.g., OracleOverrideCap) prevent authority address compromise from being catastrophic?
