  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Valid Count Manipulation] At line 120, valid_attestation_count is retrieved - can an attacker manipulate oracle state to inflate this count before min_attestations check?
