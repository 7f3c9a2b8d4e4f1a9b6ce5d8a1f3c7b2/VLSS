  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] The function is public with no access controls - can any caller update the vault's asset value for any asset_type, potentially manipulating vault valuations before deposits/withdrawals to steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Since the function is public, can an attacker repeatedly call it with different asset_types to force excessive gas consumption and DoS the vault's operation flow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call update_navi_position_value() during a vault operation to manipulate the op_value_update_record and bypass operation value checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] The function is public - can anyone call it with arbitrary account addresses to extract sensitive position information about other users' Navi holdings? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Access Control] Since get_defi_asset() is called, does it properly validate that the asset_type corresponds to a NaviAccountCap and not another asset type, preventing type confusion attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Type Confusion] If an attacker passes an asset_type that exists in the vault but is not a NaviAccountCap (e.g., a Cetus position), will get_defi_asset() fail safely or return the wrong asset causing incorrect value calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Validation] Can an attacker pass a non-existent asset_type to cause get_defi_asset() to abort, preventing legitimate value updates and freezing vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Type Safety] If two different NaviAccountCap instances have different IDs (e.g., NaviAccountCap1, NaviAccountCap2), can mixing up asset_type strings cause the wrong account to be valued? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Type Mismatch] Does the PrincipalCoinType generic parameter match what's expected by the vault, or can an attacker call this with a wrong type causing runtime errors or silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] At line 63, get_asset_price() is called - if the OracleConfig's update_interval is manipulated (via compromised admin), can stale prices be accepted causing incorrect valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Staleness] If the oracle price was updated just before the update_interval expires, can an attacker front-run with a malicious price update to manipulate the vault valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Bypass] Does get_asset_price() at line 63 properly validate that the price timestamp from the Switchboard aggregator is recent, or can old cached prices be used? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Price Decimals] The oracle price has 18 decimals (ORACLE_DECIMALS) - are there any precision loss issues when multiplying with ray_math scaled balances (27 decimals) at lines 65-66? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle DoS] If get_asset_price() reverts for any coin_type in the loop (lines 43-72), does the entire valuation fail, allowing an attacker to DoS value updates by corrupting one asset's oracle? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Front-Running] Can an attacker observe a pending update_navi_position_value() transaction and front-run it with an oracle price update to manipulate the calculated value? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Price Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Switchboard aggregator feed (if permissioned) right before this function is called to inflate/deflate position values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Index Manipulation] At lines 48-52, dynamic_calculator::calculate_current_index() is used instead of storage.get_index() - can an attacker manipulate the clock to get favorable supply/borrow indexes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Index Calculation] The TODO comment at line 46 suggests uncertainty about dynamic vs static indexes - if dynamic indexes are always higher, can borrowers benefit from inflated debt values reducing their actual obligations? (High)",
