  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [StructDef: PoolRewardInfo] [Reward Depletion Attack] If total_reward - total_reward_allocated can become negative due to incorrect accounting, can this cause underflow and allow attackers to drain the entire reward balance plus additional funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [StructDef: PoolRewardInfo] [Ended Reward Extension] After ended_at_seconds is reached, if reward_per_seconds is not set to zero, can attackers continue claiming rewards indefinitely from a reward program that should have ended? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: find_reward_info_index()] [Type Confusion in Reward Lookup] Does find_reward_info_index<X,Y,R>() properly validate that R matches one of the reward_coin_type entries in reward_infos, or can it return an index for a different reward type, causing incorrect reward distribution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: total_reward()] [Reward Total Manipulation] If total_reward() can be called before total_reward_allocated is updated, can an attacker observe incorrect available rewards and claim more than allocated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: total_reward_allocated()] [Allocated Reward Underflow] If total_reward_allocated() returns a value that decreases due to refunds or cancellations, can this cause reward distribution logic to underflow and distribute excessive rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_per_seconds()] [Reward Rate Update Attack] Can reward_per_seconds be updated by a non-admin mid-emission period, allowing an attacker to front-run with low reward_per_seconds to capture cheap liquidity incentives, then increase it to attract their own liquidity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_growth_global()] [Growth Rate Overflow] When calculating reward_growth_global as (reward_amount * Q128 / liquidity), if liquidity is very small or reward_amount is very large, can this overflow u128 and cause incorrect per-liquidity reward tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_ended_at()] [Reward End Time Bypass] If reward_ended_at() can be extended by updating ended_at_seconds without providing additional reward tokens, can this dilute existing rewards and cause LPs to receive less than expected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_last_update_at()] [Stale Timestamp Exploitation] If reward_last_update_at() returns a stale timestamp and rewards are calculated based on current_time - last_update_time, can an attacker trigger updates after long delays to claim accumulated rewards that should have been distributed earlier? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_length()] [Reward Index Out of Bounds] If reward_length() returns an incorrect count and other functions use this to index into reward_infos without bounds checking, can this cause out-of-bounds access or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: reward_info_at()] [Invalid Index Access] Does reward_info_at(index) validate that index < reward_infos.length(), or can passing index >= length cause a panic or return uninitialized memory? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Event: UpdatePoolRewardEmissionEvent] [Reward Emission Frontrun] If UpdatePoolRewardEmissionEvent is emitted before reward_per_seconds is updated, can an attacker observe the event and front-run to claim old rewards before the new emission rate takes effect? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [StructDef: PoolRewardCustodianDfKey] [Custodian Key Collision] If PoolRewardCustodianDfKey<X> uses only a dummy_field=bool, can multiple reward types hash to the same dynamic field key, causing reward balance collisions and loss of funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: observations] [Observation Vector Overflow] Can observations vector grow unbounded if observation_cardinality_next is continuously increased without actually growing the vector, causing out-of-bounds access when writing observations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: observation_index] [Index Wraparound Attack] When observation_index wraps around after reaching observation_cardinality, does the implementation properly overwrite the oldest observation, or can stale observations remain, causing incorrect TWAP calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: observation_cardinality] [Cardinality Shrink Attack] If observation_cardinality can be decreased after observations are written, can this cause observation_index to point to an out-of-bounds slot, corrupting observation data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: observation_cardinality_next] [Cardinality Increase Race] If observation_cardinality_next is increased but the observations vector is not immediately grown, can concurrent writes cause observation overwrites or missing observations, breaking TWAP integrity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: observe()] [TWAP Manipulation] Does observe() properly interpolate between observations when seconds_ago doesn't exactly match an observation timestamp, or can attackers exploit interpolation rounding to manipulate TWAP values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: observe()] [Out of Bounds Seconds Ago] If observe() is called with seconds_ago values larger than the oldest observation's age, does it return an error or extrapolate incorrectly, potentially returning invalid price data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: observe()] [Empty Observations Vector] Can observe() be called on a newly initialized pool where observations is empty or has only one entry, causing array access errors or returning zero/invalid cumulative tick values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Function: borrow_observations()] [Observation Mutation] Does borrow_observations() return an immutable reference, or can external code mutate observations to insert fake historical price data for TWAP manipulation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Event: ObservationCardinalityUpdatedEvent] [Cardinality Update Timing] If ObservationCardinalityUpdatedEvent is emitted but observation_cardinality_next is not immediately applied, can external protocols relying on this event make incorrect assumptions about available TWAP granularity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: observations] [Timestamp Ordering Violation] If observations are written out of chronological order due to Clock timestamp manipulation or bugs, can this break the binary search in observe() and return incorrect TWAP values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [StructDef: Pool<X,Y>] [Phantom Type Mismatch] Can a Pool<X,Y> be created where phantom types X and Y don't match the actual type_x and type_y TypeName fields, allowing type confusion when extracting reserves or performing swaps? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/pool.move] [Struct Field: type_x] [TypeName Spoofing] If type_x is set manually instead of derived from type_name::get<X>(), can an attacker create a pool with mismatched types where type_x claims to be USDC but reserve_x is actually a worthless token?
