  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Rate Overflow Check] At line 428, rate is checked against max_value / 86_400_000, but can attacker set rate just under this limit causing overflow in subsequent multiplications at line 498? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Time Delta Manipulation] At line 498, time delta is calculated as (now - last_updated) - can attacker manipulate clock timestamp to cause overflow or underflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Initial Last Updated] At line 298, last_updated is set to current timestamp - can attacker exploit timing by adding rewards immediately after creation to skip distribution period? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Rate Zero Handling] At line 483, if rate == 0, only last_updated is modified - can this be exploited to freeze rewards while advancing time? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_to_buffer()] [Buffer Update Before Addition] At line 395, update_reward_buffer is called before adding new rewards at line 398 - can this ordering be exploited to manipulate distribution state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Remaining Reward Zero] At line 504, if remaining_reward_amount == 0, only timestamp updates - can attacker repeatedly trigger this to advance time without distributing rewards? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Min vs New Reward] At line 512, reward_amount = min(remaining, new_reward) - can attacker exploit when remaining < new_reward to cause permanent reward lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Rate Update Without Distribution] At line 433, buffer is updated before rate change - can old rate be exploited for extra rewards before new rate takes effect? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Last Updated Modification] At line 536, last_updated is set to now - can this be manipulated to skip distribution periods by controlling transaction timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: remove_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Pre-Removal Update] At line 321, update_reward_buffer is called before checking remaining == 0 at line 324 - can this cause unexpected reward distribution during removal? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffers()] [Multi-Buffer Update] At lines 459-461, all buffer types are updated in loop - can gas limits cause partial updates leaving system in inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Timestamp Comparison] At line 482, only updates if now > last_updated - can equal timestamps cause missed distributions in same-block transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_to_buffer()] [No Rate Validation] Function add_reward_to_buffer doesn't validate distribution rate exists - can rewards be added to zero-rate buffer causing permanent lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Actual Reward Zero] At line 518, actual_reward_amount can be 0 if below minimum - can repeated zero distributions cause timestamp to advance while rewards accumulate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Rate Precision] Rate at line 437 is u256 with no decimal specification - can precision loss in rate calculation cause reward distribution inaccuracies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Distribution Table Mutation] At line 484 and 505, distributions table is mutated - can concurrent modifications cause race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Buffer Table Addition] At line 291, buffer.reward_amounts.add is called - can this fail if reward type already exists in main rewards but not buffer? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [New Reward Calculation] At line 498, new_reward = rate * time_delta - if time_delta is very large (system downtime), can this overflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Buffer Creation Timing] At lines 249-260, buffer distribution can be created with_buffer flag - can attacker control timing to manipulate initial distribution state? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Multiple Distribution Checks] Function checks rate==0, remaining==0, and minimum at different points - can edge cases where all three conditions interact cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Max Rate Constant] At line 428, max rate uses hardcoded 86_400_000 (milliseconds per day) - can future timestamp changes invalidate this constraint? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Minimum Reward Timing] At line 513, minimum is calculated with current total_shares - can attacker manipulate shares just before update to bypass minimum? (High)",
