  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call this function without proper operator/admin caps to manipulate vault asset values, given that the function is public and may lack authorization checks before modifying vault state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Status Bypass] If vault status is 'disabled' or 'during_operation', can this function still execute and update asset values, potentially violating the operation lifecycle invariant that value updates should only occur in specific states? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker create a reentrant call path through the pool reference to call update_momentum_position_value multiple times in a single transaction, causing double-counting of position values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker pass mismatched generic types where PrincipalCoinType doesn't match the vault's actual principal type, causing type confusion and incorrect value updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Asset Type Mismatch] Can an attacker provide an asset_type string that doesn't match the actual CoinA/CoinB types in the pool, leading to value calculation for wrong assets and incorrect USD value storage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Stale Oracle] If the OracleConfig contains stale prices but passes validation, can the function update vault values with outdated data, violating the staleness tracking invariant and causing loss tolerance miscalculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Clock Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Clock reference to use incorrect timestamps in finish_update_asset_value, causing assets_value_updated to be set to future/past times and bypassing epoch-based tolerance checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Missing Staleness Check] Does the function verify that clock.timestamp_ms() is within acceptable bounds before storing it as the last update time, potentially allowing updates with invalid timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Wrong Asset Type] What happens if vault.get_defi_asset() is called with an asset_type that exists but doesn't contain a MomentumPosition, will it panic or return incorrect data leading to calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Missing Asset] If the asset_type doesn't exist in the vault's DeFi assets, does get_defi_asset handle this gracefully or will it abort, potentially causing DoS on legitimate value updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Position Ownership] Does the function verify that the retrieved MomentumPosition actually belongs to the vault and hasn't been borrowed/transferred elsewhere, preventing updates on positions the vault no longer owns? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Switchboard oracle to return prices that pass the slippage check but are still significantly different from true market prices, causing incorrect USD valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Price Division by Zero] In the calculation 'price_a * DECIMAL / price_b', if price_b is zero (oracle failure or manipulation), will this cause a division by zero abort or return incorrect relative price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Integer Overflow] When calculating 'price_a * DECIMAL', can this overflow u256 if price_a is extremely large (e.g., for low-decimal tokens), causing incorrect relative_price_from_oracle calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate pool liquidity or execute sandwich attacks to temporarily align pool_price with oracle price during the slippage check, then profit from the actual price difference after value update? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Calculation Overflow] In the assertion 'pool_price.diff(relative_price_from_oracle) * DECIMAL / relative_price_from_oracle', can the multiplication overflow u256 for extreme price differences, causing the check to fail incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Check Precision Loss] Does the slippage calculation lose precision due to integer division, potentially allowing prices slightly outside acceptable bounds to pass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Zero Slippage Edge Case] If config.dex_slippage() returns 0, will the assertion always fail even for perfectly matching prices due to precision issues, causing DoS on value updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Maximum Slippage Bypass] If config.dex_slippage() is set to SLIPPAGE_BASE (10000 = 100%), does this effectively disable the slippage check, allowing any pool price and enabling oracle manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Decimal Mismatch] If config.coin_decimals() returns incorrect decimals for CoinA or CoinB, will this cause systematic under/overvaluation of positions in USD terms? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Missing Decimal Validation] Does the function validate that decimals_a and decimals_b are within reasonable bounds (0-18), or can extreme values cause overflow/underflow in price conversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Type Name Confusion] Can an attacker register a malicious coin type with a name that matches CoinA/CoinB but has different decimals in OracleConfig, causing price calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Amount Overflow] When casting 'amount_a as u256' and 'amount_b as u256', can this fail if amounts exceed u64::MAX, or are amounts always guaranteed to fit in u64? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Zero Liquidity Position] If the position has zero liquidity (amount_a = 0, amount_b = 0), will get_position_value return 0, and does this correctly represent an empty position or could it mask errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Normalized Price Inconsistency] Can normalized_price_a and price_a from oracle diverge significantly due to different decimal handling, causing the slippage check to pass but value calculation to use wrong prices? (High)"
