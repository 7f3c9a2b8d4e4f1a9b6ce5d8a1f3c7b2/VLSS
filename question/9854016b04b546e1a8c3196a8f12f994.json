  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: earned()] [Storage Mutation] Line 362 takes storage as &mut for read-only operation - could this block concurrent reads or enable unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: earned()] [Missing Pool Silent Return] Lines 371-392 only execute if pool exists, returning empty vectors otherwise - could UI/callers misinterpret empty rewards as zero earned vs. invalid pool? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: earned()] [Reward Calculation Duplication] Function duplicates calc_pool_update_rewards logic - could divergence between earned() and actual claiming cause user confusion or frontrunning? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveBal] [Key Store Abilities] IncentiveBal has key+store abilities allowing it to be wrapped or transferred - could attacker wrap IncentiveBal in malicious object to bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveBal] [Asset Field] asset field is u8 with no validation - could asset values collide between different pools causing reward cross-contamination? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveBal] [Current_idx Field] current_idx is set once at creation but vectors can grow - could outdated current_idx cause index misalignment? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: PoolInfo] [Vector Length Invariant] PoolInfo contains 10 parallel vectors that must maintain same length - what enforces this invariant across all mutations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: PoolInfo] [Table Memory Growth] index_rewards_paids, user_acc_rewards, user_acc_rewards_paids are vectors of tables - unbounded user accounts could cause storage exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Shared Object] Incentive is shared object accessible globally - does this enable concurrent modification races? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Creator Immutable] creator field is set once in init - if creator compromised, no recovery mechanism exists? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Owners/Admins Tables] owners and admins tables use u256 keys - are these intended as hashes or could u256 collisions occur? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Ray Division] Line 167 ray_div for rate calculation - what if ray_div implementation has bugs or ray precision causes rate to be 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Time Difference Overflow] Line 250 casts (end_time - start_time) to u256 - if subtraction result is near u64::MAX, could cast overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Safe Math Multiplication] Line 255 uses safe_math::mul - does this abort on overflow or wrap, and could overflow be triggered intentionally? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Ray Math Precision] Line 329 divides by ray() to convert rewards - could ray precision loss cause users to lose small reward amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [U256 Arithmetic] Line 329 subtracts u256 values - are all subtraction points checked for underflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Amount Casting] Line 166 casts amount (u64) to u256 - is u64 sufficient range for reward amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Clock Dependency] Lines 140 uses clock::timestamp_ms - if clock is manipulated or skewed, could pools be created with invalid timings? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Time Progression] last_update_time is always set to current_timestamp - what if current_timestamp < last_update_time due to clock issues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Time Window Logic] Lines 238-245 adjust start/end times - could edge cases like start==end cause division by zero or zero rewards when valid rewards should accrue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Reward Period Overlap] If multiple pools have overlapping time periods for same asset, could rewards accumulate incorrectly? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [State Mutation Order] Function updates user_acc_rewards_paid before balance split - if split fails, is state corrupted? (High)",
