  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Type Name Oracle Mismatch] If into_string(get<CoinA>()) produces a different string than what's registered in OracleConfig, will get_asset_price fail or return wrong prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Missing Oracle Prices] If OracleConfig doesn't have prices for CoinA or CoinB, does get_asset_price abort gracefully or cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Normalized vs Raw Price Divergence] Can normalized_price_a differ from price_a in ways beyond decimal adjustment, causing the slippage check and value calculation to use inconsistent price data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Direction] Does the slippage check work correctly for both pool_price > oracle_price and pool_price < oracle_price scenarios, or can one direction bypass the check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Diff Function Underflow] If pool_price < relative_price_from_oracle, can the diff() function underflow when computing the absolute difference? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Slippage Base Confusion] SLIPPAGE_BASE is 10000 (100%), but if config.dex_slippage() uses a different base (e.g., 100 or 1000000), will the comparison be incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Assert vs Return] The function uses assert! for slippage checks - should it return an error instead to allow graceful handling and prevent DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can an attacker use flash loans to temporarily manipulate pool_price to match oracle prices during value updates, then revert prices afterward to profit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [MEV Exploitation] Can MEV bots front-run value updates to ensure pool prices are within slippage bounds, then back-run to restore actual prices, extracting value from the vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Vault State Corruption] If vault.finish_update_asset_value fails or reverts after usd_value is calculated, can this leave vault in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Asset Type Key Collision] Can different positions share the same asset_type String key, causing one update to overwrite another's value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Missing Return Check] Does get_defi_asset return a valid reference or can it return a default/empty value that causes incorrect calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Value Update Frequency] Can this function be called repeatedly in rapid succession to manipulate vault's total_usd_value through precision loss accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Does finish_update_asset_value validate that clock.timestamp_ms() is monotonically increasing, or can out-of-order updates corrupt asset tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: update_momentum_position_value()] [Generic Type Mismatch] Can CoinA/CoinB types in the function call differ from those actually stored in the MomentumPosition, causing type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Pool Type Mismatch] If the MomentumPool<CoinA, CoinB> passed doesn't match the position's actual pool, will this cause incorrect amount calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: All Functions] [Type Witness Bypass] Can an attacker create fake CoinA/CoinB types without proper one-time witnesses to bypass type safety in position value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Type Name Collision] Can two different coin types have the same type_name string from into_string(get<T>()), causing oracle price fetching errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Multiplication Order] In 'price_a * DECIMAL / price_b', does the order of operations matter for precision - should it be '(price_a / price_b) * DECIMAL'? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_value()] [Division Rounding] Does the division 'price_a * DECIMAL / price_b' always round down, potentially systematically undervaluing positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: sqrt_price_x64_to_price()] [Double Division Precision Loss] The function divides by pow(2, 64) then by DECIMAL (or multiplies), can this compound precision loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: sqrt_price_x64_to_price()] [Squaring Precision] When squaring sqrt_price_u256_with_decimals, does integer arithmetic lose precision that could accumulate across many positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: All Functions] [DECIMAL Constant Hardcoding] DECIMAL is hardcoded to 1e18 - if oracle or system needs different decimals, will this cause systematic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Closed Position] If the position is closed or removed from pool, will the function still return valid amounts or stale/zero values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/momentum.adaptor.move] [Function: get_position_token_amounts()] [Position Fees] Does get_amounts_for_liquidity include uncollected fees, or only principal liquidity? If fees are excluded, does this undervalue positions? (High)"
