  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call add_reward_balance with a mismatched vault_id that passes the assert at line 348 if vault object is manipulated or replaced between transactions, allowing rewards to be added to wrong vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Authorization Bypass] Does assert_operator_not_freezed at line 241 prevent all scenarios where a frozen operator could add new reward types by exploiting race conditions in freeze status updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Access Control] Since create_reward_manager is public(package) at line 153, can malicious package modules create multiple RewardManagers for the same vault, causing reward distribution confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: check_version()] [Version Control Bypass] Can an attacker bypass version checks by directly calling functions that use check_version at line 186-188 with an outdated RewardManager object before upgrade_reward_manager is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: upgrade_reward_manager()] [Version Manipulation] At line 193, the version check allows version < VERSION, but could an attacker downgrade and then upgrade to reset state or exploit migration logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: remove_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Authorization] Does the operator freeze check at line 319 occur after update_reward_buffer at line 321, allowing a just-frozen operator to distribute remaining rewards before removal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: set_reward_rate()] [Rate Setting Authorization] Can multiple operators race to call set_reward_rate at lines 415-444, causing conflicting rate updates that bypass intended rate limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Receipt Status Bypass] At line 610, status is checked against NORMAL_STATUS constant, but can an attacker manipulate receipt status in vault_receipt_info to bypass this check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: retrieve_undistributed_reward()] [Fund Recovery Authorization] Does operator freeze check at line 674 prevent a malicious operator from draining undistributed rewards right before being frozen? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Vault Mismatch Attack] If vault_id changes in vault object after RewardManager creation at line 157, does the check at line 348 detect this, or can rewards be misdirected? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Duplicate Type Check] At line 289, ERR_REWARD_BUFFER_TYPE_EXISTS prevents duplicates, but can an attacker remove and re-add the same type to reset distribution parameters maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Type Addition Order] Can an attacker add multiple reward types in specific order at lines 245-247 to exploit initialization state or cause index misalignment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffers()] [Authorization Missing] Function update_reward_buffers at line 449 has no operator cap check - can unprivileged users call this to manipulate distribution timing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Public Access] Function update_reward_buffer at line 466 is public - can attackers repeatedly call it to force distribution updates and manipulate reward timing? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Vault Enabled Check] At line 603, vault.assert_enabled() is checked, but can an attacker claim rewards during vault state transitions between enabled/disabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: remove_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Remaining Reward Check] At line 324, assert checks remaining_reward_amount == 0, but can rounding errors leave dust amounts that prevent legitimate removal? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_manager()] [Shared Object Timing] At line 181, transfer::share_object is called - can attackers interact with RewardManager before vault.set_reward_manager completes at line 174? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Operator Cap Reuse] Can the same OperatorCap at line 345 be used across multiple vaults to add rewards, bypassing per-vault operator restrictions? (Medium)",
