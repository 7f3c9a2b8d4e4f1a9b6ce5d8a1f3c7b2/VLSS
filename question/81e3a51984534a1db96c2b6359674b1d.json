  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Ray Division Missing] Function only uses ray_mul() but never ray_div() - if indices should be divided instead of multiplied, can all position values be incorrectly scaled by index²? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [USD Conversion Error] vault_utils::mul_with_oracle_price() at lines 65-66 handles decimal conversions - if implementation is incorrect, can supply_usd_value and borrow_usd_value be off by orders of magnitude? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Mixed Decimals] Different coin types may use different decimals (6, 8, 9) - if oracle prices and mul_with_oracle_price() don't normalize correctly, can ETH (18 decimals) be valued 1e9x higher than USDC (6 decimals)? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Supply-Borrow Comparison] Line 74 compares total_supply_usd_value to total_borrow_usd_value - if these are calculated with different decimal precision, can comparison be incorrect allowing over-leveraged positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Zero Return Ambiguity] Function returns 0 at line 75 for underwater positions and implicitly returns 0 if no reserves - can vault distinguish between 'no position', 'zero value position', and 'underwater position' to handle correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Net Value Semantics] Function returns net value (supply - borrow) at line 78 - if vault expects gross supply value for collateral checks, can returning net value bypass liquidation protection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Return Value Ignored] Function returns nothing (line 13-29) - if value update fails or is rejected by vault, can caller detect failure or will execution continue with stale values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Borrow Overcount] Both supply_scaled and borrow_scaled are calculated at lines 53-54 from same user - if user has both supply and borrow in same asset, are they double-counted in total values leading to inflated net position? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Interest Rate Attack] If borrow_index grows faster than supply_index due to high utilization, can attacker manipulate timing of value update to capture moment when supply_index high but borrow_index not yet updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Asymmetric Scaling] Lines 53-54 scale supply and borrow with different indices - if indices diverge significantly (e.g., supply_index = 1.0, borrow_index = 2.0), can this create arbitrage where borrow value exceeds supply value incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Config Validation] OracleConfig passed at line 15 has no validation - can attacker pass malicious config with manipulated prices to set arbitrary asset values in vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Storage Version Mismatch] Storage object at line 34 may be outdated version - if Navi upgrades storage contract, can old storage interface return garbage data that calculate_navi_position_value() interprets as valid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Type Format] asset_type is String at line 17 - if format is not validated (e.g., should be",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Computational DoS] If account has positions in all Navi reserves (line 43 loop), computation could be expensive - can attacker create positions in many low-value reserves to make valuation prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Update DoS] No rate limiting or access control - can attacker spam update_navi_position_value() calls to exhaust gas or storage resources, preventing legitimate value updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Storage Read DoS] Multiple storage reads per reserve (get_user_balance, get_coin_type) - if storage is slow or expensive, can attacker make vault operations expensive by maintaining positions in many reserves? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Health Factor Bypass] Function returns net value but doesn't calculate health factor - if vault uses this value for solvency checks without health factor, can attacker maintain unsafe leverage ratios? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Liquidation Threshold Missing] No consideration of loan-to-value or liquidation thresholds - can position appear healthy (line 74-76 check) but actually be liquidatable in Navi protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Collateral Factor Ignored] Function treats all supply equally regardless of collateral factors - can attacker supply low-quality collateral that Navi discounts but vault values at full price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Function Separation] update_navi_position_value() is wrapper around calculate_navi_position_value() - can attacker call calculate_navi_position_value() directly with manipulated parameters to get incorrect values for other purposes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Parameter Mismatch] Function accepts account address at line 32 but update_navi_position_value() derives it from AccountCap at line 22 - can these ever be mismatched causing value update for wrong account? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Module: volo_vault::navi_adaptor] [Import Trust] Module imports lending_core, math, vault_oracle, vault_utils (lines 3-11) - if any of these modules are compromised or have bugs, can they cause navi_adaptor to return manipulated values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Module: volo_vault::navi_adaptor] [Version Compatibility] No version checks for imported modules - if lending_core or math modules are upgraded with breaking changes, can navi_adaptor silently produce incorrect results? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [No Pre-conditions] Function has no require() or assert() statements - can function succeed even when vault, config, storage, or clock are in invalid states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [No Post-conditions] Function has no validation of return value - can function return u256::MAX or other extreme values that violate vault invariants? (Medium)"
