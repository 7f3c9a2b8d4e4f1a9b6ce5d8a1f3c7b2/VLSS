  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Type: StakedSui] [Object Integrity] StakedSui objects are stored in ObjectTable; can malicious StakedSui objects with corrupted sui_system::staking_pool data bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Type: Balance<SUI>] [Resource Safety] Balance<SUI> is returned from remove_stakes(); if caller doesn't properly handle it, can SUI be permanently lost or duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [ObjectTable: stakes] [Key Type] Stakes ObjectTable uses u64 keys (gap-based indexing); can key collisions occur if gap/length accounting is incorrect? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Table: vaults] [Key Type] Vaults Table uses address keys; can two validators share the same address in edge cases (e.g., validator rotation), causing vault collision? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [VecMap: validators] [Ordering] VecMap maintains insertion order but is iterated by index; can this cause unexpected behavior if validators are removed and re-added? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [State Consistency] If remove_stakes() is called concurrently with add_stake() on same validator, can gap/length become desynchronized, corrupting vault state? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Race Condition] If update_validators() and sort_validators() are called in rapid succession, can is_sorted flag have wrong value, causing operations on stale sort order? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [State Machine] Can export_stakes_from_v1() be called while normal operations (add_stake/remove_stakes) are ongoing, causing accounting conflicts? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_bad_validators()] [Definition] Bad validators are defined as priority == 0; is there validation ensuring zero-priority validators don't receive new stakes? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Withdrawal Strategy] Removal uses FIFO (oldest first via gap); can this be exploited by attackers adding fresh stakes to dilute old stake holders' withdrawal priority? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake()] [Validator Selection] add_stake() accepts any validator address; is there validation that the validator is in the validators vec_map with non-zero priority? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Zero Priority] Setting priority to 0 marks validator as bad but doesn't prevent new stakes; can stakes be added to zero-priority validators, violating protocol intent? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Tie Breaking] When validators have equal priorities, insertion into sorted uses index order; is this deterministic across different validator_set states? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Invariant: Total Stake] Does sum of all vault.total_staked equal total protocol-wide staked amount, or can add_stake/remove_stakes operations break this invariant through rounding? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Invariant: Gap ≤ Length] Is gap <= length enforced at all times, or can edge cases in remove_stakes() or export_stakes() violate this, causing index errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Invariant: Validator Consistency] Are validators in vec_map always a superset of validators in vaults table, or can vault exist without corresponding vec_map entry? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Invariant: Sorted Consistency] When is_sorted is true, does sorted_validators exactly match vec_map contents in sorted order, or can they diverge through update race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Invariant: ObjectTable Keys] Are ObjectTable keys in vault.stakes always in range [gap, length), or can remove/add operations create gaps in the key space? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [External Call: sui_system::request_withdraw_stake_non_entry] [Trust] Does sui_system correctly handle StakedSui withdrawal, or can it return incorrect Balance amounts causing accounting errors? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [External Call: staking_pool::split] [Split Logic] If staking_pool::split() fails or returns incorrect StakedSui amounts, can this corrupt total_staked accounting in remove_stakes()? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [External Call: staking_pool::staked_sui_amount] [Amount Validation] Does staked_sui_amount() return the correct principal, or can rewards be included, causing total_staked inflation? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [External Call: staking_pool::stake_activation_epoch] [Epoch Check] If stake_activation_epoch() returns wrong epoch, can pending stakes be prematurely withdrawn, violating sui_system guarantees? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: sort_validators()] [Gas Cost] Sorting with nested loops (lines 116-143) has O(n²) complexity; can this cause transaction failure for MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE validators? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_bad_validators()] [Gas Cost] Loop through all sorted_validators (lines 87-99); can this be expensive for MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE validators, causing gas issues for read operations? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes()] [Unbounded Loop] While loop (line 226) can iterate through many stakes; is there a limit to prevent gas exhaustion if vault has thousands of small stakes? (Medium)"
