  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the lack of price validation to accept a manipulated price of 0 from the Supra oracle, causing vault value calculations to drastically undervalue assets and enabling theft through deposit/withdrawal price discrepancies? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Staleness] Does the function accept arbitrarily old timestamps without validation, allowing an attacker to execute operations using stale oracle data when the actual market price has moved significantly, potentially causing loss to the protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Data Integrity] The function discards the fourth return value from supra::get_price() - could this discarded value contain critical data (like a validity flag or round ID) whose absence enables acceptance of invalid oracle data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Type Overflow] When casting the price from the underlying type to u128, could there be a scenario where the original price exceeds u128::MAX, causing silent truncation and returning an incorrect price that undervalues assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Type Overflow] When casting the decimal from the underlying type to u16, could there be a scenario where the original decimal exceeds u16::MAX (65535), causing silent truncation and returning an incorrect decimal precision? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Type Overflow] When casting the timestamp from the underlying type to u128, could there be a scenario where the original timestamp exceeds u128::MAX, causing silent truncation and appearing more recent than actual, bypassing staleness checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Denial of Service] If the Supra oracle returns invalid data or reverts for a specific pair, does this function lack error handling to gracefully degrade, potentially causing all vault operations dependent on this price feed to permanently fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Decimal Validation] Does the function accept a decimal value of 0 from the oracle, which would make any subsequent decimal conversion operations divide by zero or produce undefined behavior in downstream calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Decimal Validation] Does the function accept an abnormally large decimal value (e.g., > 18) that could cause overflow in subsequent decimal conversion calculations when multiplying by powers of 10? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Authority] Does this function lack validation of which OracleHolder object is passed, potentially allowing an attacker to create a malicious OracleHolder with fake price data and pass it to manipulate vault valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Pair ID Validation] Does the function validate that the requested pair ID exists in the Supra oracle? If an invalid pair is requested, could it return default/zero values that would be interpreted as valid prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle Update Frequency] Without checking minimum update intervals, could an attacker who controls a validator or oracle updater spam price updates to manipulate prices during vault operations, front-running legitimate transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Decimal Conversion Overflow] When converting from source decimal to a higher target_decimal, the price gets multiplied by 10^(difference) - if the original price is large and the decimal difference is significant, could this cause u256 overflow in to_target_decimal_value_safe(), returning a wrapped-around value drastically different from the true price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Decimal Conversion Precision Loss] When converting from a higher source decimal to a lower target_decimal through repeated division by 10, could significant precision be lost (e.g., converting 18 decimals to 6 decimals loses 12 digits of precision), causing prices to be rounded down and systematically undervaluing assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Type Casting Vulnerability] When casting decimal from u16 to u64 for the conversion function, could there be any unintended behavior if the u16 value is at its maximum, potentially affecting the decimal conversion logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Type Casting Vulnerability] When casting target_decimal from u8 to u64, could there be edge cases where the u8 maximum value (255) causes issues in the decimal conversion algorithm when compared against the source decimal? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Type Casting Vulnerability] When casting timestamp from u128 to u64, could timestamps that exceed u64::MAX be silently truncated, causing future timestamps to appear as past timestamps and bypassing staleness validation in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Target Decimal Validation] Does the function validate that target_decimal is within reasonable bounds (e.g., 1-18)? Could an attacker specify target_decimal=0 or target_decimal=255 to cause division by zero or extreme multiplication in the conversion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Price Zero Handling] If the native price from Supra is 0, the conversion function returns 0 regardless of decimal conversion - could this enable an attacker to exploit a zero-price oracle update to drain the vault by withdrawing assets valued at zero? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Rounding Direction] The decimal conversion uses integer division which always rounds down - could this systematic rounding down be exploited through repeated operations to incrementally siphon value from the protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Decimal Mismatch Attack] Could an attacker exploit confusion between different decimal standards (e.g., the vault expects 18 decimals but receives 9) by manipulating the target_decimal parameter to cause 10^9 price inflation or deflation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Gas Exhaustion] If source and target decimals are very far apart (e.g., decimal=1, target_decimal=255), the conversion loop iterates 254 times - could this cause excessive gas consumption or even timeout in some execution environments? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Integration Risk] Since this function is called from oracle_pro.move without additional validation, could incorrect configuration of target_decimal in the oracle config cause systematic mispricing of all assets using this adaptor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Timestamp Precision Loss] Does casting the timestamp to u64 lose any meaningful precision for staleness checks? If the original timestamp uses higher precision, could this allow slightly stale prices to pass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Price Manipulation via Decimal] Could an attacker who compromises oracle configuration change the target_decimal to an unexpected value, causing all price-dependent calculations in the vault to use incorrect prices and enabling theft? (Critical)"
