  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call init_objects() multiple times before mark_cap_created() is executed, creating multiple MigrationCap objects and bypassing single-migration enforcement? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Race Condition] If mark_cap_created() execution fails after MigrationCap creation but before transaction commits, can init_objects() be called again to create duplicate migration infrastructure? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Double Migration] The assertion at line 74 checks mut_collected_rewards() != 0, but what if collected_rewards is legitimately 0 before any migration? Can this prevent valid first migrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Authorization] Does OwnerCap validation in init_objects() properly verify ownership, or can a malicious actor with a valid OwnerCap from a different pool trigger migration on the wrong pool? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Cap Transfer] MigrationCap is transferred to ctx.sender() at line 90 - can an attacker frontrun this transaction to become the recipient if sender() is predictable? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Pause Timing] If set_pause(owner_cap, true) at line 75 fails but transaction continues, can stake/unstake operations continue during migration, corrupting state? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [State Corruption] If mark_cap_created() adds a dynamic field but init_objects() is called again with a different native_pool, can multiple pools share migration state? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Sanity Check Bypass] Can collected_rewards be manipulated to exactly 0 before init_objects() to bypass the assertion at line 74 and enable double migration? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Object Sharing] MigrationStorage is shared at line 89 - can multiple entities access and corrupt the shared object during concurrent migration steps? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: init_objects()] [Cap Ownership] If MigrationCap transfer at line 90 fails but MigrationStorage is already shared, can the storage be accessed without proper authorization? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [State Flag Bypass] Can pool_created flag be manipulated after assertion at line 98 but before line 99 executes, allowing multiple stake pools to be created? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Reentrancy] If stake_pool::create_stake_pool() at line 100 calls back into migration module, can pool_created flag be checked again before being set to true? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/migration/migrate.move] [Function: create_stake_pool()] [Authorization] MigrationCap is only read at line 95 - can an attacker with a valid MigrationCap from a different migration session create pools in this migration? (High)",
