  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: update_state()] [Timestamp Manipulation] timestamp_difference calculated as (current_timestamp - last_update_timestamp) / 1000 - can clock timestamp be manipulated to inflate interest calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: update_state()] [Integer Division Loss] Dividing by 1000 at line 262 - for small timestamp differences, can this truncate to zero causing no interest accrual when interest should accrue? (High)",
