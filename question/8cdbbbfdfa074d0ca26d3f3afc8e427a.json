  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Millisecond Precision] oracle_validity_length_ms uses milliseconds but Sui block timestamps may use different precision (seconds/microseconds). Can precision mismatch cause oracle data to be incorrectly marked valid/invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validity Comparison] If oracle validity checks use >= vs >, can setting oracle_validity_length_ms to 1ms create off-by-one errors where expired data is accepted due to boundary condition handling? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Extraction] Since fee parameter at line 70 has no upper bound validation, can malicious authority set fee to u64::MAX, causing integer overflow in fee calculation and either reverting all oracle updates (DoS) or enabling fee bypass via wraparound? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Takeover] fee_recipient at line 50 can be set to any address without validation. Can compromised authority change fee_recipient to attacker address, redirecting all future oracle fees away from protocol treasury? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee to Zero] Can malicious insider authority set fee to 0 at line 70, eliminating revenue stream for oracle operators and causing oracles to stop updating prices, indirectly DoS'ing dependent vaults? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Validation] No validation that fee_recipient at line 50 is non-zero address or valid account. Can setting fee_recipient to 0x0 cause fees to be burned/lost, reducing oracle incentives and degrading data quality? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Frontrunning] If fee changes take effect immediately via set_configs() at line 47, can authority frontrun user oracle request transactions by increasing fee right before user TX processes, extracting maximum fee from unsuspecting users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Retroactive] Does fee change at line 49 apply retroactively to queued oracle requests? If yes, can authority wait until queue is full, then spike fee to extract excess fees from already-committed requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Calculation Overflow] If fee is used in percentage calculations (e.g., amount * fee / BASIS_POINTS), can setting fee > BASIS_POINTS cause amounts to exceed original value, creating value extraction vulnerability? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Contract] If fee_recipient at line 50 is set to a malicious contract address that reverts on receive, will oracle fee distributions fail, locking fees in the queue and disrupting oracle operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event-State Mismatch] If queue.set_configs() at line 47 reverts internally but error is suppressed, will QueueConfigsUpdated event still emit at line 63, causing off-chain indexers to record incorrect config state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay] QueueConfigsUpdated event at lines 55-62 includes all config params but not timestamp or nonce. Can identical config updates emit identical events, confusing indexers about which update is current? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Event Fields] QueueConfigsUpdated doesn't include previous config values or update timestamp. Can this hide malicious config changes from monitoring systems that only check absolute values, not deltas? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] If multiple run() calls execute in same transaction, will events at line 63 emit in execution order? Can event reordering hide which config change was final, enabling authority to obfuscate malicious updates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spamming] Since event emission at line 63 has no cooldown, can authority spam identical config updates to flood event logs and obscure other critical events in the queue system? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Before State] Event is emitted after set_configs() at line 63, but if set_configs() has side effects that modify other state, are those captured in the event? Can event show incomplete state change? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Non-Atomic Update] validate() at line 76 and actuate() at line 82 are separate calls. If validate() reads queue state X and actuate() runs when state is Y (changed by concurrent TX), does this violate atomicity, allowing inconsistent config updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Partial Update] If queue.set_configs() at line 47 updates fields sequentially and can fail mid-update, will queue be left in partially-updated state with mixed old/new config values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy] If queue is a shared object and set_configs() can trigger external calls (e.g., notifying oracles), can reentrancy occur where a second run() call modifies configs while first is still executing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Rollback] If event::emit() at line 63 fails (though unlikely), will the set_configs() changes at line 47 be rolled back, or will queue be in updated state without event notification? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Concurrent Updates] If two authority holders call run() simultaneously with different configs, which update wins? Can race condition result in non-deterministic final state? (Medium)",

Can queue state change between validation read and actuate() write, bypassing validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Invariant Breaking] If set_configs() updates min_attestations and oracle_validity_length_ms independently, can partial failure leave queue in invalid state where existing oracle submissions don't meet new min_attestations requirement? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Oracle Censorship] By setting min_attestations higher than number of honest oracles, can malicious authority ensure that price updates never achieve consensus, censoring oracle data and freezing vault operations dependent on prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Cartel] If min_attestations is reduced to very low value at line 51, can a cartel of malicious oracles now control price feeds with minimal participation, manipulating prices to liquidate vault users?
