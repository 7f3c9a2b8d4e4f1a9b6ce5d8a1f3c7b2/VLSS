  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: execute_deposit()] [Operator Freeze Check] assert_operator_not_freezed() at line 391 - if operator is frozen after deposit request was created, should deposit still be executable or blocked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Vector Length Mismatch] request_ids and max_shares_received vectors at lines 413-414 - if lengths don't match, does index_of at line 424 panic or use wrong slippage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Index Race] Lines 424-425 find index in request_ids, but if request_ids contains duplicates, which index is used for max_shares_received? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: batch_execute_deposit()] [Reward Buffer Once] update_reward_buffers() called once at line 418 for entire batch - if batch processes across epoch boundary, are later deposits using stale reward rates? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Cancel Window] Clock at line 442 used for timing checks - if deposit has locking window, can operator bypass lock by calling cancel after execution window started? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: cancel_user_deposit()] [Buffered Coin Transfer] Line 446 transfers buffered_coin to recipient - if recipient is a shared object or malicious contract, can it cause reentrancy? (Medium)",
