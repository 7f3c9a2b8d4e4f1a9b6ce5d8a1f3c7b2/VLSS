  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Name Collision] Can the name be changed to match another existing queue's name, causing confusion in off-chain systems that identify queues by name rather than ID? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Empty Name] Can the name be set to an empty string, causing identification issues in UIs and off-chain services that display queue information? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Integrity] The QueueConfigsUpdated event is emitted after queue.set_configs() is called. If set_configs() reverts for any reason, will the transaction abort before event emission, or could there be a scenario where events are emitted without actual state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Consistency] The event emits all parameters including fee, but there's no verification that the emitted values match what was actually stored by queue.set_configs(). If set_configs() has internal logic that modifies parameters, could emitted events misrepresent actual state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spam] Can an authority call run() repeatedly with the same parameters to emit duplicate QueueConfigsUpdated events, confusing off-chain indexers or analytics systems that assume each event represents an actual config change? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] If multiple run() calls occur in the same transaction or block, is the event ordering guaranteed to match the actual execution order, or could off-chain systems reconstruct queue state incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Reentrancy] Although Sui Move has reentrancy protection, if the Queue object's set_configs() method makes external calls or emits events that trigger callbacks, could state be inconsistent between validate() and actuate() execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [TOCTOU] There's a time-of-check-to-time-of-use gap between validate() and actuate(). If Queue state can be modified by another transaction between these calls, could validation be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Transaction Ordering] Can an attacker submit multiple run() transactions with different config values and manipulate transaction ordering to ensure their desired config is applied last, potentially front-running legitimate authority's config update? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Race] If two authorities call run() simultaneously with different configs, is there deterministic ordering, or could the final state be unpredictable based on consensus ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Module Integration] The function calls queue.set_configs() without checking return values. If set_configs() has partial failure modes or returns error codes, could the action succeed with invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Circular Dependency] If the Queue module's has_authority() method depends on configurations set by this action, could there be circular dependency issues preventing legitimate authority changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Version Mismatch] If the Queue module is upgraded independently of this action module, could incompatible interfaces cause silent failures or unexpected behavior in set_configs()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue State Assumptions] The validation assumes the Queue object is in a valid state. If Queue can be in a paused or emergency state, should this action be blocked, or could it be exploited to change configs during emergency situations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Parameter Relationship] There's no validation of relationships between min_attestations and oracle_validity_length_ms. Can setting min_attestations very high and oracle_validity_length_ms very low create an impossible-to-satisfy configuration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee-Validity Interaction] Can the combination of high fees and short oracle_validity_length_ms make oracle queries economically infeasible, as operators must constantly re-attest but earn low revenue per query? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Configuration Atomicity] All config parameters are updated atomically in one call. If only one parameter needs changing, must all others be re-specified, and could this lead to accidental config overwrites? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validation DoS] Can an attacker who gains authority repeatedly call run() with configs that just barely pass validation but are economically infeasible, griefing legitimate oracle operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Gas Griefing] Are the validation checks gas-efficient, or could an attacker submit many failing validation attempts to waste network resources? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Cost] Can spamming run() calls with different configs cause excessive event emission costs, griefing the authority or clogging event streams? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Information Leakage] The error constants reveal implementation details (EInvalidAuthority, EInvalidQueueVersion). Could attackers use error messages to probe for authority addresses or queue version information? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert Ordering] The asserts are executed in a specific order (version, authority, min_attestations, oracle_validity). Could reordering them prevent certain attacks or improve gas efficiency for common failure cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Partial Execution] If any validation assert fails, the entire transaction aborts. Could this be exploited to prevent config updates by causing specific validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Volo Vault Impact] If oracle_validity_length_ms is set too high and stale prices are accepted, could Volo Vault operations use outdated price feeds to calculate incorrect vault values, enabling value extraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Health Limiter Impact] If min_attestations is reduced to 1, could the Volo health limiter make incorrect health factor decisions based on single-oracle price feeds, allowing unsafe borrowing positions? (Critical)"
