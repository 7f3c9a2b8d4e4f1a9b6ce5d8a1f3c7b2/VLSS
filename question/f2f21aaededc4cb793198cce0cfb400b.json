  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: update_state_of_all()] [Index Manipulation] If an attacker can add malicious reserves before this is called, can they cause the loop to update attacker-controlled indices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: update_state_of_all()] [Race Condition] If multiple transactions call update_state_of_all concurrently, can they interfere causing some reserves to be updated twice and others skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/logic.move] [Function: update_state_of_all()] [Order Dependency] Does the order of reserve updates matter? Can an attacker benefit from knowing update order to time their operations? (Low)",
