  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call update_receipt_value with arbitrary vault and receipt_vault references to manipulate asset valuations without operator/admin privileges, since the function is public and has no capability checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a malicious operator freeze specific receipts by controlling receipt_vault status checks via assert_normal() at line 29, while the main vault remains in normal status, causing valuation DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Authorization Bypass] Since get_receipt_value is public, can external contracts call it with manipulated vault states to obtain incorrect valuations and exploit dependent systems? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Access Control] Can an attacker repeatedly call update_receipt_value during vault operations (status=1) to manipulate op_value_update_record and bypass operation value tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Receipt Mismatch] The commented-out self-vault check at lines 23-28 suggests no enforcement preventing vault from holding its own receipts - can this create circular value dependencies causing infinite valuation or DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Receipt Validation] If assert_vault_receipt_matched at line 47 only checks vault_id equality, can an attacker create receipts with matching vault_ids but invalid receipt_ids to bypass validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the get_defi_asset call at line 31 by registering a fake Receipt object under the same asset_type String to extract or manipulate vault assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Receipt Mismatch] If the receipt retrieved at line 31 belongs to a different vault than receipt_vault, will the assert_vault_receipt_matched check at line 47 fail, and can this be exploited for valuation manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Status Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate VaultReceiptInfo status to PENDING_WITHDRAW_WITH_AUTO_TRANSFER_STATUS (value 3) at line 55 to artificially deflate receipt value by subtracting pending_withdraw_shares, enabling underpriced asset acquisitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Accounting Error] If status is set to 3 and pending_withdraw_shares exceeds total shares at line 56, will the subtraction underflow causing valuation to wrap to maximum u256? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Status Manipulation] Can an attacker front-run update_receipt_value by changing receipt status to 3 immediately before valuation, then revert it after, to temporarily suppress value and exploit price-dependent operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Logic Error] The comment at line 40 states 'avoid operator attack' - but if operator controls status transitions, can they still manipulate status to 3 during valuation to hide share value for their benefit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Race Condition] Between lines 52 and 56, if another transaction changes pending_withdraw_shares, can the shares calculation become inconsistent with actual vault state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Status Bypass] Can an attacker set status to any value other than 0-3 to bypass the status==3 check at line 55, causing shares to not be reduced when they should be? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Accounting Manipulation] Can an attacker inflate shares() at line 52 before valuation to increase vault_share_value at line 65, then deflate shares after to extract excess value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Share Inflation] If get_share_ratio at line 49 returns manipulated values during operations, can the vault_share_value calculation at line 65 be exploited for share price manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Precision Loss] Does mul_d at line 65 properly handle share_ratio decimal precision (1e9), and can rounding errors accumulate across multiple receipts to drain vault value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Zero Shares Attack] If shares at line 52 is zero but pending_deposit_balance and claimable_principal are non-zero (lines 67, 71), can an attacker create receipts with no shares but claim pending/claimable value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Share Subtraction] When status is 3 and shares is reduced by pending_withdraw_shares at line 56, if this results in zero or near-zero shares, does it incorrectly suppress the entire receipt value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Value Components] The three value components at lines 65, 66-69, 70-73 are summed at line 75 - can an attacker manipulate each component independently to cause overflow at summation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the OracleConfig passed at line 19 to cause get_normalized_asset_price at lines 59-63 to return inflated/deflated principal_price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Stale Price] Does get_normalized_asset_price at lines 59-63 validate price freshness using clock, or can stale oracle prices be used to over/undervalue receipts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Price Decimals] The oracle price used in mul_with_oracle_price at lines 66-69 and 70-73 expects 1e18 decimals - can incorrect decimal conversions cause 1e9 precision errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Type Name Attack] Can an attacker register fake type names via type_name::get<T>().into_string() at line 62 to retrieve manipulated prices from the oracle config? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Oracle Bypass] Can update_receipt_value be called with an arbitrary OracleConfig that doesn't match the vault's actual config, causing incorrect valuations to be stored? (Critical)"
