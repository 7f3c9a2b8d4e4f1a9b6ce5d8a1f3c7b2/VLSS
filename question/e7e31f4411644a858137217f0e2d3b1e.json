  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_borrow_fee_rate()] [Rate Change Timing] set_borrow_fee_rate() immediately updates rate without waiting for epoch boundary - can attacker front-run rate increase by borrowing maximum amount at old rate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_enable_by_rule_id()] [Reward Loss] set_enable_by_rule_id() can disable rule without updating user rewards first - can admin disable rule right before user claims, causing user to lose accrued rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Rate Limit Bypass] set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id() sets max_rate using ray_div() but set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() only checks 'rate <= max_rate' - can precision loss in ray_div() allow setting rate slightly above intended max_rate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Divide by Zero] set_max_reward_rate_by_rule_id() computes ray_div(max_total_supply, duration_ms) - if duration_ms=0, does ray_div() panic or return max u256, allowing infinite reward rate? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Stale Index] set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() calls update_reward_state_by_asset(@0x0) before setting rate - does using @0x0 properly update global_index, or can it leave stale global_index causing incorrect user rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Rate Calculation Error] set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() computes rate = ray_div(total_supply, duration_ms) only if duration_ms > 0, else rate=0 - can attacker set duration_ms=0 to permanently disable rewards without explicit disable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Max Rate Enforcement] set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() checks 'max_rate == 0 || rate <= max_rate' - if max_rate=0 (no limit), can admin accidentally set astronomical rate causing reward fund insolvency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: set_reward_rate_by_rule_id()] [Timestamp Update] set_reward_rate_by_rule_id() updates rule.last_update_at after setting rate - if clock goes backwards due to timestamp manipulation, can duration become negative in future calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_mut_rule()] [Rule Lookup] get_mut_rule() returns mutable rule reference but doesn't verify rule is in correct pool - can type confusion allow mutating wrong rule if multiple pools have same rule_id? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rules()] [Length Mismatch] base_claim_reward_by_rules() asserts coin_types and rule_ids have same length - if assertion passes but vectors are modified after check, can out-of-bounds access occur in the loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Disabled Rule Bypass] base_claim_reward_by_rule() returns zero balance if rule.enable=false - can attacker enable rule, let users accrue rewards, disable rule, then steal reward_fund since users can't claim? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Reward Calculation Race] base_claim_reward_by_rule() reads user_total_reward then user_reward_claimed in separate table lookups - can concurrent update between reads cause incorrect reward calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Claimed Amount Overflow] base_claim_reward_by_rule() sets user_reward_claimed = user_total_reward - if user_total_reward overflows u256 but claimed doesn't, can user claim rewards multiple times? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Balance Split Error] base_claim_reward_by_rule() calls balance::split(&mut reward_fund.balance, reward as u64) - if reward > u64::MAX, does cast truncate high bits allowing user to claim less than entitled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Insufficient Reward Fund] base_claim_reward_by_rule() calls balance::split() without checking reward_fund.balance >= reward - if fund is depleted, does transaction panic causing DoS for all claimants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rule()] [Zero Initialization] base_claim_reward_by_rule() adds user_rewards_claimed[user]=0 if not exists - can attacker call claim before any rewards accrue to pollute table with zero entries for griefing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: base_claim_reward_by_rules()] [Event Index Mismatch] base_claim_reward_by_rules() emits RewardClaimed with rule_indices vector - if base_claim_reward_by_rule() fails for some rules, can indices vector be shorter than rule_ids causing off-chain index confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Front-Running] claim_reward() is public and updates user rewards before claiming - can attacker front-run user's claim with their own deposit to inflate total_supply and reduce user's reward share? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: claim_reward_with_account_cap()] [AccountCap Misuse] claim_reward_with_account_cap() uses account::account_owner() to get sender - can attacker create fake AccountCap struct with arbitrary owner to claim others' rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_effective_balance()] [Index Overflow] get_effective_balance() multiplies balances by indices using ray_mul() - can large supply/borrow indices cause overflow in ray_mul(), breaking effective balance calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_effective_balance()] [Supply-Borrow Offset] get_effective_balance() calculates effective_supply = supply - borrow if supply > borrow - can attacker manipulate ratio of supply/borrow to game which rewards they earn (supply vs borrow incentives)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_effective_balance()] [Zero Effective Balance] get_effective_balance() returns zero effective_supply and zero effective_borrow if supply == borrow - can attacker balance their position to avoid earning any rewards while still using protocol liquidity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_effective_balance()] [Storage Mutation] get_effective_balance() takes &mut Storage but only reads - can malicious code exploit mutable borrow to modify storage during balance calculation causing inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_effective_balance()] [Index Staleness] get_effective_balance() uses storage::get_index() which may be stale - if indices aren't updated before calling get_effective_balance(), can users earn rewards on outdated balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: update_reward_state_by_asset()] [Missing Pool Check] update_reward_state_by_asset() returns early if pool doesn't exist - can this allow skipping reward updates for assets that should have pools, causing reward loss?
