  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: normal_amount()] [Target Decimal Hardcoding] Why is target_decimal hardcoded to 9 instead of 18 (common DeFi standard), and can this mismatch with other protocols cause integration issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: unnormal_amount()] [Source Decimal Hardcoding] Similarly, why assume source is always 9 decimals, and what happens if unnormal_amount() is called on amounts not previously normalized? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: convert_amount()] [Amount Modification] Since amount is reassigned in the loop, can this cause issues if the function is inlined and the original amount variable is expected to remain unchanged? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: convert_amount()] [Decimal Increment Safety] Is cur_decimal + 1 safe from overflow since cur_decimal is u8 and max value is 255? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: convert_amount()] [Decimal Decrement Safety] Is cur_decimal - 1 safe from underflow since cur_decimal might be 0? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: normal_amount()] [Composability] Can normal_amount() be safely called multiple times on the same amount without compounding errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: unnormal_amount()] [Composability] Can unnormal_amount() be safely called multiple times on the same amount without compounding errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: convert_amount()] [Type Confusion] Does convert_amount() work correctly for all CoinType parameters, or can custom coin implementations break the decimal logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: get_coin_decimal()] [Type Parameter] Can get_coin_decimal() be called with a different CoinType than the pool was created with, returning incorrect decimal values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: convert_amount()] [Mathematical Correctness] Is the conversion mathematically correct for all valid inputs, or are there edge cases where amount * 10^delta != original_amount * 10^(target - cur)? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Reentrancy] Can the transfer::public_transfer() call be exploited for reentrancy if the recipient is a contract that calls back into pool operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Return Value Handling] If the caller of withdraw_balance() does not properly handle the returned Balance<CoinType>, can funds be lost or locked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Recipient Control] Can the PoolAdminCap holder withdraw treasury funds to an arbitrary recipient, enabling fund extraction to attacker-controlled addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Friend+Cap Requirement] Does requiring both friend access and PoolAdminCap provide meaningful additional security, or is one of these checks redundant? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Amount Validation] Does withdraw() validate that amount > 0, or can zero-value withdrawals waste gas and pollute event logs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Early Return Bypass] The early return for amount == 0 creates a zero balance - can this zero balance be used maliciously in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Balance Check Timing] Is the assertion on treasury_balance checked atomically with the balance::split() operation, or can a race condition cause insufficient balance after the check? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Balance Check Timing] Similarly, can the assertion on pool.balance be bypassed through timing attacks in concurrent transactions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Balance Split Safety] Does balance::split(&mut pool.balance, amount) provide overflow protection, or can extreme amount values cause issues? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Coin Creation] Does coin::from_balance() always succeed, or can it fail for certain CoinType implementations, locking the withdrawn balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Coin Creation] Similarly, can coin::from_balance() fail in withdraw_treasury(), leaving treasury funds in an intermediate state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Transfer Safety] Does transfer::public_transfer() guarantee delivery to the recipient, or can it fail if recipient is invalid/destroyed? (Medium)",
