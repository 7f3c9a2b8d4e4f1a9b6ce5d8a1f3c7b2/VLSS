  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: mul_with_oracle_price()] [Attack: Oracle Manipulation] If oracle price can be manipulated, can attacker use mul_with_oracle_price() to inflate asset valuations fraudulently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: div_with_oracle_price()] [Attack: Oracle Manipulation] Can attacker manipulate oracle to make div_with_oracle_price() return excessive asset amounts during withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: parse_key()] [Attack: Key Collision] Can attacker create custom types that generate the same parse_key() output as legitimate vault assets to corrupt asset tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: clone_vecmap_table()] [Attack: DoS via Large Map] Can attacker bloat VecMap with entries to make clone_vecmap_table() extremely expensive, DOSing vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: mul_d() vs mul_with_oracle_price()] [Logic Error] Can developers confuse these functions and use wrong decimal constant, causing 1 billion-fold calculation errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: div_d() vs div_with_oracle_price()] [Logic Error] Can developers confuse these functions and use wrong decimal constant, causing catastrophic valuation errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: to_decimals() vs to_oracle_price_decimals()] [Usage Error] If caller uses wrong conversion function, can this cause 1 billion-fold errors in asset amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: from_decimals() vs from_oracle_price_decimals()] [Usage Error] If caller uses wrong conversion function, can this cause massive precision loss or incorrect values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: mul_d()] [Gas Optimization] Is there a more gas-efficient way to perform decimal multiplication that reduces computation costs in high-frequency operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: clone_vecmap_table()] [Gas Cost] Does cloning large VecMaps consume excessive gas, making vault operations prohibitively expensive for normal users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: parse_key()] [Gas Cost] Does string concatenation and conversion consume excessive gas when called repeatedly in asset tracking operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: mul_d()] [Specification] Is it documented that mul_d() rounds down, and are callers aware of this behavior in safety-critical calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: div_d()] [Specification] Is it documented that div_d() can revert on division by zero, and do all callers validate inputs appropriately? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Constants] [Specification] Is it documented why DECIMALS is 1e9 and ORACLE_DECIMALS is 1e18, and are these values compatible with all integrated protocols? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Constants: DECIMALS] [Migration Risk] If DECIMALS constant needs to change in a future version, can existing vault state be safely migrated without loss of precision? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/utils.move] [Function: clone_vecmap_table()] [State Migration] If this function is used in vault upgrades, can it handle all legacy VecMap formats safely? (Low)"
