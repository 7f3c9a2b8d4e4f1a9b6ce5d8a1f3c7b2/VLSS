  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Critical Unimplemented Function] The refund() function aborts with code 0 instead of refunding coins - if any Volo component calls this function expecting funds to be returned to users, all refund operations will fail causing permanent fund lock and denial of service. What is the blast radius of systems depending on this function? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: to_seconds()] [Critical Unimplemented Function] The to_seconds() function aborts with code 0 instead of converting milliseconds - if vault operations, epoch calculations, or time-locked withdrawals depend on this conversion, all time-based logic will fail causing operational DoS and potential fund lock. What systems use this time conversion? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Fund Loss via Abort] If the vault adaptors (Navi, Cetus, Suilend, Momentum) attempt to refund excess funds or failed operation assets using this function, the abort(0) will cause transaction failure with the coins still locked in the calling context, leading to permanent fund loss. Has this integration been tested? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: to_seconds()] [Time Logic Failure] If vault locking windows, withdrawal delays, or epoch-based operations use to_seconds() for time calculations, the abort will cause all time-gated operations to fail, potentially preventing withdrawals indefinitely or breaking epoch rollover logic. What is the fallback mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Module: utils] [Dependency Risk] This module is located in local_dependencies/mmt_v3, suggesting it's a third-party AMM dependency. If MMT v3 integration for liquidity operations depends on these utility functions, all AMM-related operations will fail. Has the integration with actual MMT v3 been verified? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Generic Type Safety] The refund function accepts any Coin<X> type but provides no implementation - if called with vault share tokens, LST tokens, or protocol tokens, the abort could occur after state changes but before refund completion, leading to inconsistent state. What types can be passed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Access Control Missing] The refund() function is public with no capability requirements - any caller can attempt to trigger it with any coin and recipient address, though it will abort. If this is later implemented without proper access control, it could allow unauthorized fund transfers. What is the intended security model? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: to_seconds()] [Overflow/Precision Issues] When implemented, millisecond to second conversion (divide by 1000) could have precision loss for sub-second timing or overflow issues for very large millisecond values. If used for financial calculations or epoch timing, this could cause calculation errors. What are the expected input ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Module: utils] [Testing Gap] The presence of abort(0) stub implementations suggests this code is not production-ready. If deployed to mainnet, any caller of these functions will experience transaction failure. Has the deployment checklist verified all dependencies are implemented? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Coin Destruction] If refund() is called with coins that should be returned to users, the abort will cause the transaction to revert, but the coin object may be destroyed or left in an inconsistent state depending on when in the transaction flow it's called. Are there coin balance invariants that could be violated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Module: utils] [Version Mismatch] The module is named mmt_v3 suggesting version 3 of an AMM, but the stub implementation suggests incomplete integration. If other parts of the codebase expect MMT v3 functionality but receive abort errors, version confusion could lead to integration failures. Is the correct MMT version being used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Error Code Semantics] The abort uses error code 0, which is non-descriptive and could mask the actual issue (unimplemented function vs other errors). If error handling logic treats code 0 as success or a different error type, debugging and incident response will be compromised. What error handling strategy is used? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: to_seconds()] [Public Function Risk] The to_seconds() function is public, allowing any module to call it. If other modules in the Volo protocol depend on this for time calculations without checking for implementation, they will fail unexpectedly. Are all call sites protected with proper error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Module: utils] [Compilation vs Runtime] While the code compiles successfully (abort is valid Sui Move), runtime behavior will fail all callers. This creates a disconnect between static analysis (no compilation errors) and runtime behavior (all calls fail). Has runtime testing covered all code paths calling these functions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/utils.move] [Function: refund()] [Transaction Atomicity] If refund() is called as part of a multi-step transaction (e.g., operation completion, asset return, refund excess), the abort will cause the entire transaction to revert, potentially leaving operations in inconsistent states if not properly structured. Are atomic transaction boundaries correctly defined? (High)"
