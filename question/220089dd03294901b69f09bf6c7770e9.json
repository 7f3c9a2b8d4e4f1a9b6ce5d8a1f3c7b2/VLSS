(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools_group_by_phase()] [Pool Enumeration DoS] At lines 272-334, loop through all pool objects—if thousands of pools exist, can this cause transaction to fail due to gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools()] [Repeated Oracle Calls] At line 65, calculate_one_from_pool may internally call oracle—if called for each pool in a loop, can excessive oracle reads cause gas spikes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: insert_pools()] [Quadratic Complexity] At lines 343-353, for each pool insertion, the entire pools vector is scanned—if 1000 pools with 100 phases exist, can O(n²) complexity cause DoS? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_apy()] [u64 to u256 Cast] At lines 163-165, multiple u64 values cast to u256 for time calculations—can any intermediate results exceed u256 bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools()] [u8 Asset ID] At line 104, asset_id is u8 (0-255)—if protocol scales beyond 256 reserves, can asset_id overflow and cause incorrect reserve lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools()] [Address to ID] At lines 48-62, pool addresses are used as IDs—can address collisions or zero addresses cause incorrect pool data retrieval? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentivePoolInfo] [Available Calculation] At line 83 and 329, available is calculated as total - claimed—if this underflows, the struct field becomes invalid, can this propagate corrupt data to UI? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveAPYInfo] [APY Overflow] At line 94, apy field is u256—if accumulated APY exceeds u256::MAX (though practically impossible), can this cause struct creation to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentivePoolInfo] [Factor Field] At line 26, factor is u256—if factor represents a multiplier and is set to MAX, can this cause overflow when used in calculations? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools()] [Closed_at Field] At line 54, closed_at is extracted but never used in calculations—if a pool is manually closed before end_at, can rewards still accrue incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_apy()] [End Before Start] At line 163, (end_at - start_at) assumes end_at > start_at—if a pool is misconfigured with start_at > end_at, can this cause underflow and incorrect APY? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive.move] [Function: get_incentive_pools_group_by_phase()] [Future Start Time] If start_at is far in the future (e.g., year 2100), can timestamp arithmetic overflow when used in calculations? (Low)",
