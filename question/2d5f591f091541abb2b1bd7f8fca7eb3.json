  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Excessive Claim Amount] If amount > self.claimable_principal, does underflow occur and wrap claimable_principal to u64::MAX, and can subsequent claims drain vault using this inflated claimable amount? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Partial Claim Tracking] If amount < self.claimable_principal (partial claim), is remaining claimable_principal correctly preserved, and can attacker exploit multiple partial claims to exceed total claimable amount through rounding errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Double Claim Race] Can two simultaneous update_after_claim_principal() calls for same amount both succeed if external vault doesn't properly lock, enabling attacker to double-claim the same claimable_principal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Zero Amount Claim] If amount = 0, does function no-op correctly, or can zero claims be used to manipulate state or emit misleading events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Deposit-Withdraw Race] If update_after_request_deposit() and update_after_request_withdraw() are called in quick succession, can status ping-pong between PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS and PENDING_WITHDRAW_STATUS, and does this break assumptions in external vault logic about operation exclusivity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Execute Without Status Check] Since none of update_after_execute_deposit/withdraw() explicitly verify current status matches expected pending state, can execute functions be called in wrong state, causing shares and pending balances to become desynchronized? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Cancel-Execute Ordering] If update_after_cancel_deposit() is called after update_after_execute_deposit() processes same pending deposit, does cancelled_deposit_balance underflow from 0 causing pending_deposit_balance to wrap to u64::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Reward Update During Pending Operations] Can update_reward() be called while status is PENDING_DEPOSIT or PENDING_WITHDRAW, and if shares are used in reward calculation while pending operations are active, can this cause reward over/under-allocation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Share Inflation Via Deposit-Reward Timing] If attacker calls update_after_request_deposit(), then external vault calls update_reward() before execute_deposit(), are rewards calculated on old shares or new shares, and can attacker game timing to claim rewards on shares they don't yet own? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Claim During Pending Withdrawal] Can update_after_claim_principal() be called while status is PENDING_WITHDRAW_STATUS, and if claimable_principal from previous withdrawal exists, can user claim it while simultaneously having active pending withdrawal, effectively double-withdrawing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Multiple Functions] [Simultaneous Pending Operations] Since pending_deposit_balance and pending_withdraw_shares can both be non-zero simultaneously (if requests are made but not executed/cancelled), can this create logic errors in external vault when trying to determine user's true position? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_deposit()] [Zero Deposit Request] Can pending_deposit_balance parameter be 0, and if so, does this waste gas and pollute status by setting PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS without actual deposit, potentially blocking legitimate operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_request_withdraw()] [Zero Withdraw Request] Can pending_withdraw_shares parameter be 0, setting status to PENDING_WITHDRAW but with no actual pending withdrawal, blocking user from making legitimate deposit until they cancel the phantom withdrawal? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_deposit()] [Zero Share Execution] If new_shares = 0 and executed_deposit_balance > 0, does user permanently lose their deposit funds without receiving any shares, and is this exploitable for fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_execute_withdraw()] [Zero Share Withdrawal] If executed_withdraw_shares = 0 but claimable_principal > 0, does user receive principal without burning shares, enabling infinite withdrawal attack? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_after_claim_principal()] [Zero Claim] Can amount = 0 in update_after_claim_principal(), and if so, does this allow meaningless state updates or event emissions that confuse off-chain systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: new_vault_receipt_info()] [Missing Table Initialization] If reward_indices and unclaimed_rewards Tables are passed in empty, does first update_reward() call correctly initialize them, or can race conditions occur if multiple reward types are added concurrently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Field Invariant Violation] Is there an invariant that pending_withdraw_shares ≤ shares, and if so, can it be violated through race conditions in request/cancel/execute calls, enabling user to withdraw more than they own? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Pending Balance Invariant] Should pending_deposit_balance only be non-zero when status is PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS, and can this invariant be violated through cancel/execute race conditions leaving orphaned pending balance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Pending Withdraw Invariant] Should pending_withdraw_shares only be non-zero when status is PENDING_WITHDRAW_STATUS or PENDING_WITHDRAW_WITH_AUTO_TRANSFER_STATUS, and can invariant violation leave orphaned pending withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Struct: VaultReceiptInfo] [Claimable Principal Source] Should claimable_principal only exist if prior execute_withdraw occurred, and can claimable_principal be non-zero with PENDING_DEPOSIT_STATUS, creating impossible state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: update_reward()] [TypeName Collision] Can two different reward token types hash to same TypeName causing Table key collision, and if so, do rewards get mixed up enabling attacker to claim high-value reward by depositing low-value reward type? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: get_receipt_reward()] [Missing Key Handling] If reward_type doesn't exist in unclaimed_rewards Table, function returns 0, but should it differentiate between 'no reward type registered' vs 'reward is actually 0', to prevent confusion about which rewards are available? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reset_unclaimed_rewards()] [Type Parameter Mismatch] If RewardCoinType generic doesn't match any existing TypeName in unclaimed_rewards Table, does borrow_mut panic, and can attacker cause DoS by claiming non-existent reward type? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/vault_receipt_info.move] [Function: reward_indices_mut()] [Mutable Reference Leak] Since reward_indices_mut() returns mutable reference to entire Table, can external code directly manipulate indices without going through update_reward(), corrupting reward accounting and enabling theft? (Critical)"
