(Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker exploit line 104 where *total = *total + value without overflow check, causing epoch tracking to wrap to zero and bypass max_supply_for_2epochs limits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: unwrap_unstake_ticket()] [Integer Underflow] Can metadata.total_supply underflow at line 145 if tickets are burned when total_supply < ticket.value, resulting in u64::MAX total supply and breaking all accounting invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: get_max_supply_for_2epochs()] [Integer Overflow] Can line 90 total = total + *table::borrow(...) overflow if both current and previous epoch values are near u64::MAX, causing incorrect supply cap calculations? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Accounting Error] If value parameter is u64::MAX, does line 114 metadata.total_supply + value overflow silently, allowing infinite tickets to be minted? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: add_to_epoch()] [Overflow Attack] Can an attacker call wrap_unstake_ticket repeatedly with large values to overflow the table entry at line 104, resetting epoch tracking to zero and bypassing withdrawal limits? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: unwrap_unstake_ticket()] [Underflow DoS] If total_supply is manipulated to be less than ticket values through prior underflow, can subsequent unwrap calls at line 145 panic and DoS all ticket redemptions? (High)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: is_unlocked()] [Validation Bypass] Since is_unlocked at lines 65-67 is only a view function, can callers of unwrap_unstake_ticket ignore unlock_epoch entirely, redeeming tickets immediately after creation? (Critical)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: create_metadata()] [Initialization Attack] Can create_metadata at line 49 be called multiple times by package modules to create duplicate Metadata objects with independent total_supply tracking? (High)",
