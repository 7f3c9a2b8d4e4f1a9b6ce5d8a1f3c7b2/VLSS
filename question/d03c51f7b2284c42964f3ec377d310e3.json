(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Module Dependencies] [Queue Module Trust] This module completely trusts Queue.add_fee_type() implementation - if Queue module is upgraded maliciously, can it accept arbitrary fee types regardless of validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Module Dependencies] [Type Name Module] The module relies on std::type_name - if this standard library has bugs in type name resolution, can fee types be misidentified? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Module Dependencies] [Event System] The module uses sui::event::emit - if event system has bugs or can be blocked, does fee type addition still succeed silently? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Type Ordering Attack] If queue fee selection prioritizes by position in fee_types vector, can an attacker add preferred coin types last to manipulate fee payment order?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_add_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Atomic Batch] There is no batch_run function - if multiple fee types need to be added atomically, can partial failures leave the queue in unintended configuration?
