  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Update Permission] Does finish_update_asset_value at line 35 have proper access control, or can it be called with arbitrary usd_value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Value Validation] Does finish_update_asset_value validate that usd_value at line 35 is reasonable, or can extremely large/small values be stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Receipt Lifetime] If the Receipt object retrieved at line 31 is destroyed or transferred during update_receipt_value, can it cause inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Receipt Reference] Since receipt at line 44 is a reference, can modifications to the original Receipt object affect valuation during get_receipt_value execution? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Receipt Ownership] Does assert_vault_receipt_matched at line 47 verify receipt ownership, or only vault_id matching? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Invalid Status Transition] Can status transition from non-3 to 3 between get_receipt_value calls without proper validation, enabling valuation manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Status Persistence] If status is 3 and never transitions back, does the receipt remain permanently undervalued? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Status Check Timing] The status check at line 55 occurs after shares retrieval at line 52 - can this ordering be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Division by Zero] If share_ratio from line 49 is used in division elsewhere, can zero share_ratio cause division errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Negative Value] Can any of the value calculations at lines 65, 66-69, 70-73 produce negative results that are silently converted to large positive u256? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Precision Loss Accumulation] Across multiple receipts, can cumulative precision loss from mul_d and mul_with_oracle_price significantly affect total vault value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value() calling get_receipt_value()] [Function Call Exploit] Can the call to get_receipt_value at line 33 be manipulated by modifying receipt_vault state between the call and finish_update_asset_value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Parallel Execution] Can multiple parallel calls to update_receipt_value with the same receipt cause race conditions in finish_update_asset_value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Mutable Reference] The mutable reference to vault at line 17 - can concurrent modifications to vault state cause inconsistent updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Borrow Rules] Does Move's borrow checker prevent simultaneous mutable borrows of vault and receipt_vault if they're the same object? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Immutable Reference] The immutable reference to vault at line 42 - can it become stale if vault state changes during get_receipt_value execution? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Asset Type String] Can asset_type at line 22 be an empty string or contain invalid characters, causing issues in get_defi_asset or finish_update_asset_value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: update_receipt_value()] [Type Mismatch] If asset_type doesn't correspond to an actual Receipt<PrincipalCoinTypeB>, does get_defi_asset at line 31 properly fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/receipt_adaptor.move] [Function: get_receipt_value()] [Value Formula Correctness] Is the formula at line 39-40 (Share Value + Pending Deposit + Claimable Principal) economically sound, or can it double-count value? (High)",
