  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Math] [U256 Arithmetic] Price value is u256, can intermediate calculations in downstream consumers (price * amount / decimals) overflow even with safe inputs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Math] [Decimal Conversion] With decimals up to 16 and prices up to u256::MAX, can conversions to dollar values cause overflow when multiplying by token amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Math] [Timestamp Subtraction] current_ts - price.timestamp assumes current_ts >= price.timestamp, but Move doesn't have built-in underflow checks for u64 subtraction? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Math] [Index Increment] Batch update loop increments i with i = i + 1, can this overflow if len is u64::MAX causing infinite loop? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Friend Access] [Unauthorized Friend] Can oracle_pro or oracle_manage modules be replaced with malicious versions post-deployment to abuse friend privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Friend Access] [Friend Function Bypass] Can friend modules call update_price() to bypass OracleFeederCap requirements, undermining the intended access control model? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Friend Access] [Migration Abuse] oracle_version_migrate() is friend-only, can malicious friend modules trigger migrations at inappropriate times to disrupt operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Friend Access] [No Friend Limits] Are there restrictions on what friend modules can do with update_price(), or can they bypass all validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Dependencies] [Error Code Conflicts] oracle_error module provides error codes, can conflicts with Sui framework error codes cause incorrect error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Dependencies] [Version Module Trust] version_verification() relies on oracle_version module, can that module be compromised to bypass version checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Dependencies] [Constant Module Changes] oracle_constants provides default values, can changes to these constants mid-deployment break existing oracles? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Test Functions] [Test Function Exposure] init_for_testing() is marked test_only, but can it be called in production if compilation flags are incorrect? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Test Functions] [Version Test Access] version_verification_for_testing() exposes internal version check logic, can this leak implementation details for exploit development? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Staleness Check Bypass] If update_interval is set to u64::MAX - 1, and current_ts is u64::MAX, can the staleness check current_ts - timestamp <= update_interval incorrectly pass for any timestamp? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Initial Price Attack] Can malicious admin register a new token with price = 1 and decimal = 1, making the token appear extremely cheap for initial vault deposits before updating to real price? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price()] [Price Freeze Attack] Can a compromised feeder set price to 0, and since get_token_price() requires value > 0 for validity, does this permanently DoS all operations dependent on that price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_price()] [Friend Front-Running] Can oracle_pro friend module front-run legitimate feeder updates by calling update_price() with manipulated prices just before the feeder's transaction? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: price_object()] [Unbounded Read] Can external modules call price_object() to read prices without any access control, potentially leaking price information before public announcements? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: update_token_price_batch()] [Atomicity Failure] If the batch contains 100 updates and update 50 fails, do updates 1-49 persist while 50-100 revert, causing partial price state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Interval Front-Running] Can attacker front-run set_update_interval() with their own update_token_price() to exploit the old interval before it changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: oracle_version_migrate()] [Version Equality Edge Case] The assertion allows oracle.version == this_version(), can calling migrate on an already-migrated oracle cause unexpected side effects? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Struct: PriceOracle] [Shared Object Griefing] Since PriceOracle is shared, can an attacker submit many transactions touching it to create consensus overhead and slow down the network? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_token_price()] [Return Value Misuse] Function returns 3 values (bool, u256, u8), can consumers destructure incorrectly or ignore the bool flag leading to stale price usage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Decimal Upper Bound] Maximum decimal of 16 is enforced, but can this cause precision loss for tokens that need 18+ decimals (like ETH derivatives)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle.move] [Function: register_token_price()] [Decimal Lower Bound] Minimum decimal of 1 is enforced, but can tokens requiring 0 decimals (like NFTs priced in whole units) be properly represented? (Medium)"
