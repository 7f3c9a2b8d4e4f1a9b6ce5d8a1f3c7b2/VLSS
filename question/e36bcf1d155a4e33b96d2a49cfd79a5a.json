  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Timing: No Refresh] [Stale State Operations] If withdraw() or claim_fees() is called without calling refresh() first in current epoch, can severely stale exchange rates cause users to receive wrong amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Access: Package Scope] [Package-Level Access] All mutative functions are public(package) at lines 54, 75, 80, 99, 131, meaning any module in suilend package can call them - can malicious co-modules exploit this? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Access: Admin Cap] [Admin Cap Usage] Only rebalance() uses admin cap at line 123, but if admin cap is compromised or shared, can attacker call increase_validator_stake() with malicious parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Access: No Pause Mechanism] [Emergency Stop] There's no pause flag or emergency withdrawal mechanism - if a critical bug is found, can operations be stopped before exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Access: View Functions] [Information Leakage] View functions at lines 32-51 are public(package) but expose internal state - can this information be used to front-run operations or perform MEV attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Economic: Fee Extraction] [Yield Theft] If claim_fees() can be called by any package module, can a malicious module extract all accrued rewards before legitimate users withdraw, stealing yield? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Economic: Exchange Rate Manipulation] [Rate Gaming] If an attacker can manipulate liquid_staking exchange rate (via large stakes/unstakes), can they profit by calling withdraw() at favorable rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Economic: Minimum Stake] [Small Deposit Attack] If MIN_DEPLOY_AMOUNT is 1 SUI, but minimum liquid_staking mint is higher, can deposits accumulate in sui_balance without earning yield, reducing overall APY? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Economic: Validator Commission] [Commission Changes] If SUILEND_VALIDATOR changes commission from 0% to 100%, all staking rewards are lost - is there monitoring or protection against this? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Economic: Rounding Accumulation] [Death by Thousand Cuts] The ceiling rounding in unstake_n_sui() at line 177-178 causes slight over-unstaking - over thousands of transactions, does this accumulated loss become significant? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [DoS: Division by Zero] [Total Supply Zero] If all LST is unstaked and total_sui_supply becomes 0, unstake_n_sui() will panic at line 178 - can an attacker force this state to DoS all withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [DoS: LST Balance Depletion] [Insufficient LST] If lst_balance is depleted through operations but withdrawals are still owed, can users be unable to withdraw because unstake_n_sui() panics at line 179? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [DoS: Validator Jailed] [Validator Unavailable] If SUILEND_VALIDATOR is jailed or removed, can increase_validator_stake() at line 121-128 fail, preventing all rebalance() operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [DoS: Gas Griefing] [Excessive Refresh] If refresh() is gas-expensive and must be called before each operation, can an attacker force many refresh calls to DoS the protocol via gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [DoS: Invariant Lock] [Assertion Failures] If the invariant check at line 154 fails during claim_fees(), the transaction aborts - can an attacker manipulate state to make this assertion always fail, locking fee claims? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Precision: Ceiling Division] [Over-Redemption] The ceiling calculation at line 177-178 always rounds up lst_to_redeem, meaning users get slightly more SUI than proportional - does this cause lst_balance to deplete faster than liabilities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Precision: U128 Casting] [Precision Loss] When casting u64 to u128 at lines 173-174, then back to u64 at line 179, can precision be lost in the intermediate calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Precision: Ratio Calculation] [Exchange Rate Precision] The ratio (sui_amount_out * total_lst_supply) / total_sui_supply at line 178 may lose precision if numbers are small - can this cause users to receive 0 LST for small withdrawals? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Precision: Buffer Amount] [1 SUI Buffer] The MIST_PER_SUI buffer in claim_fees() at line 141 is a fixed 1 SUI - if protocol grows to billions of SUI, is this buffer too small or too large? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Lifecycle: Initialization] [Treasury Cap Bypass] If create_staker() checks treasury_cap has zero supply at line 58, but the cap can be manipulated between check and use, can initialization be corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Lifecycle: First Deposit] [Zero State Operations] If deposit() is called before any rebalance(), all SUI stays in sui_balance earning no yield - should there be automatic rebalancing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Lifecycle: Final Withdrawal] [Exit Strategy] If all users withdraw, liabilities drops to 0, but can some dust remain in lst_balance or sui_balance that's irrecoverable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Lifecycle: Upgrade Path] [Migration] If staker needs to be upgraded, is there a safe way to migrate state (admin, balances, liabilities) to a new contract? (Medium)",
