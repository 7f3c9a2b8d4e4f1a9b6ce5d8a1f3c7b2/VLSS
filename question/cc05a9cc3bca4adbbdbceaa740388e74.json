  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: reward_growth_inside_last()] [Index Validation Risk] If reward_growth_inside_last() doesn't validate reward_index < reward_length(), could out-of-bounds access corrupt memory or return attacker-controlled values from adjacent storage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: is_empty()] [Incorrect Logic Risk] If is_empty() only checks liquidity == 0 but ignores owed_coin_x/y and coins_owed_reward, could positions with claimable fees/rewards be incorrectly classified as empty and deleted, losing user funds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: momentum_adaptor] [Value Calculation Risk] Since momentum_adaptor uses tick_lower_index(), tick_upper_index(), and liquidity() to calculate token amounts, if these return manipulated values, could position USD value be inflated to bypass loss_tolerance checks and steal vault funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: momentum_adaptor] [Oracle Manipulation Risk] If Position fields can be set to cause get_amounts_for_liquidity() to return extreme token amounts, could this amplify oracle manipulation attacks by multiplying small price deviations into large value changes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: momentum_adaptor] [Tick Manipulation Risk] If tick_lower/upper_index can be set to values near current pool price, could attackers create concentrated positions that experience massive value volatility, exploiting vault's loss_tolerance to steal funds during price swings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: liquidity operations] [Position Mutation Risk] If add_liquidity/remove_liquidity in liquidity.move (which also abort) don't properly update Position fields, could vault's cached position value become stale, leading to incorrect share pricing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: fee collection] [Fee State Synchronization Risk] If collect operations update fee_growth_inside but Position.owed_coin_x/y aren't updated atomically, could race conditions enable double-claiming fees or losing fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Tick Precision Risk] Since tick indices are I32 (signed 32-bit), if tick spacing is very small, could the limited range cause precision loss in liquidity distribution, misvaluing positions near extreme prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Liquidity u128 Precision Risk] With liquidity as u128, if pool prices are very high/low, could liquidity-to-token-amount conversions lose precision via repeated division, systematically undervaluing positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Fee Growth Precision Risk] fee_growth values are u128 accumulated over time - if these overflow or wrap, could modular arithmetic cause negative fee calculations, crediting instead of debiting users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Owed Coin Truncation Risk] owed_coin_x/y are u64 while fee_growth is u128 - if fee calculation multiplies u128 values before truncating to u64, could this silently lose dust amounts that accumulate to significant value over many positions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: liquidity()] [Liquidity Underflow Risk] If remove_liquidity allows removing more liquidity than Position.liquidity contains due to unchecked subtraction, could liquidity underflow to near-u128::MAX, massively inflating position value and enabling vault theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Ownership Risk] Position has 'key' ability making it a standalone object - if transfer/deletion isn't properly gated, could attackers steal positions from vault by directly transferring the object ID? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Modification Risk] Position has 'store' ability allowing storage in bags - if vault stores positions in a bag without proper access controls, could operators directly modify position fields to manipulate accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Function: All Getters] [Reference Safety Risk] All getters take &Position - if the real implementation returns mutable references disguised as immutable, could callers modify position state unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Integration: vault storage] [Access Control Risk] If vault stores Position objects in defi_assets bag without capability checks, could malicious operators bypass vault.borrow_defi_asset() and directly modify positions to manipulate valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Pool Sync Risk] If Position.pool_id can diverge from the actual Pool object it references (due to pool upgrades/migrations), could stale pool_id cause operations to use wrong pool state, corrupting accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Type Consistency Risk] If Position.type_x and type_y can be changed after creation, could type confusion attacks enable swapping position assets with different-valued tokens to steal funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Tick Invariant Risk] If tick_lower_index can be set equal to or greater than tick_upper_index, could this cause liquidity math functions to return zero or negative amounts, breaking vault accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Liquidity Invariant Risk] If Position.liquidity can be non-zero while tick range is zero (lower == upper), could division by tick range cause panics in liquidity calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Fee Growth Monotonicity Risk] If fee_growth_inside_x/y_last can decrease over time (due to bugs or overflows), could this cause owed fee calculations to underflow, preventing fee collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Reward Consistency Risk] If reward_infos vector length can change without updating related state, could reward index references become invalid, causing out-of-bounds access panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: PositionRewardInfo] [Reward Accumulation Risk] If reward_growth_inside_last can be set to values exceeding actual global reward growth, could subsequent reward calculations underflow, stealing protocol rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Module: position] [Upgrade Risk] Since all functions abort, if this module is upgraded with real implementations, will existing Position objects stored in vault bags remain compatible, or could incompatible field changes corrupt vault accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/position.move] [Struct: Position] [Migration Risk] If vault migrates from stub to real mmt_v3 implementation, will existing Position objects have uninitialized fields (since init() aborts), causing undefined behavior when accessed? (High)"
