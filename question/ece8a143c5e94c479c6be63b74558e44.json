[
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: withdraw_unchecked()] [Market Value Lower Bound] The function uses ctoken_market_value_lower_bound for allowed_borrow_value_usd but ctoken_market_value for deposited_value_usd - can this asymmetry cause health calculations to be incorrect after withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Liquidation Check Bypass] The function only checks is_liquidatable() at the start - if the obligation becomes healthy mid-execution due to reentrancy or external state changes, does liquidation still proceed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Close Factor Calculation] The function uses CLOSE_FACTOR_PCT (20%) to limit liquidation amount - but the check uses weighted_borrowed_value_usd, can an attacker manipulate borrow weights to liquidate more than 20% of actual debt? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Full Liquidation Condition] When borrow.market_value <= 1, full liquidation is allowed - can an attacker exploit this by inflating market values just above 1 to avoid full liquidation when they should be fully liquidatable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Bonus Calculation] The liquidation bonus includes liquidation_bonus + protocol_liquidation_fee - if either of these is very large, can the total bonus exceed 100%, causing withdraw_value to exceed repay_value unrealistically? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Deposit Collateral Insufficient] When deposit.market_value < withdraw_value, the function adjusts repay_pct - but what if this calculation results in a very small final_settle_amount that doesn't improve the obligation's health? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Max Repay Percentage] The max_repay_pct is calculated as div(max_repay_value, borrow.market_value) which should be <= 1 - but if market values are stale or manipulated, can this exceed 1 and cause over-liquidation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Withdraw Amount Floor] The final_withdraw_amount uses floor() which truncates - can repeated liquidations with floor truncation cause collateral to be withdrawn without corresponding debt repayment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Repay Before Withdraw] The function calls repay() then withdraw_unchecked() - if repay fails mid-execution, does withdraw_unchecked still execute, or are all changes rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Reserve Array Index Bounds] The function accesses reserves using repay_reserve_array_index and withdraw_reserve_array_index - are these indices validated to prevent out-of-bounds access? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Return Value Mismatch] The function returns (final_withdraw_amount, final_settle_amount) - can a caller exploit discrepancies between these values and actual amounts transferred? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: forgive()] [Forgivable Condition] The function checks is_forgivable() which only verifies deposits are empty - can an attacker create an obligation with only borrows and no deposits to force protocol bad debt forgiveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: forgive()] [Unlimited Forgiveness] There's no cap on max_forgive_amount - can an attacker create multiple obligations with zero collateral and maximum debt to drain protocol reserves via forgiveness? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: forgive()] [Repay Delegation] The function delegates to repay() - does repay() properly handle the case where debt is being forgiven vs. normally repaid for accounting purposes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: forgive()] [Bad Debt Tracking] The obligation.bad_debt_usd field exists but appears unused - should forgiveness update this field, and can its absence cause accounting inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_healthy()] [Upper Bound Usage] The function compares weighted_borrowed_value_upper_bound_usd to allowed_borrow_value_usd - can price spreads between upper bound and actual market value be exploited to appear healthy while being underwater? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_healthy()] [Equal Case] The function uses le() (less than or equal) - if values are exactly equal, is the obligation considered healthy or unhealthy, and can attackers exploit the boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_healthy()] [Decimal Precision] Since both values are Decimals, can precision loss in prior calculations cause is_healthy() to return incorrect results near the boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_liquidatable()] [Market Value vs Upper Bound] The function uses weighted_borrowed_value_usd (not upper bound) compared to unhealthy_borrow_value_usd - can this discrepancy with is_healthy() create arbitrage where an obligation is liquidatable but healthy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_liquidatable()] [Greater Than Only] The function uses gt() (greater than) not gte() - can obligations sitting exactly at the liquidation threshold avoid liquidation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_liquidatable()] [Close LTV vs Open LTV] The function implicitly uses close_ltv via unhealthy_borrow_value_usd - can the gap between open_ltv and close_ltv be exploited to maintain positions that should be liquidatable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_forgivable()] [Only Checks Deposits] The function only verifies vector::length(&obligation.deposits) == 0 - should it also check if borrowed values are below some threshold to prevent forgiving large debts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_forgivable()] [No Value Check] The function doesn't check deposited_value_usd or other cached values - can stale state where deposits vector is empty but deposited_value_usd > 0 cause incorrect forgiveness? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Division By Zero] The function divides by borrow_weight(config(reserve)) - if borrow_weight is zero, does this cause a panic, or is there a check preventing zero borrow weight? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Saturating Sub] The function uses saturating_sub which returns zero on underflow - can this hide scenarios where weighted_borrowed_value_upper_bound_usd > allowed_borrow_value_usd, incorrectly suggesting borrowing is possible? (High)"
