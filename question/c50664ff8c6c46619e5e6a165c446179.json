  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker with a cloned or duplicated AdminCap object call set_vault_enabled multiple times in the same transaction to cause inconsistent vault status? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [State Corruption] If set_vault_enabled(false) is called while users have pending deposit/withdraw requests, can those requests become stuck or exploitable when vault is re-enabled? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [Race Condition] Can an operator start an operation immediately before admin calls set_vault_enabled(false), causing the operation to complete while vault is disabled with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [DoS] Can a malicious admin repeatedly toggle vault enabled status during active operations to brick user funds or prevent legitimate operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [Missing Validation] Does set_vault_enabled() check if vault is currently during an operation (VAULT_DURING_OPERATION_STATUS) before allowing status change? If not, can this corrupt operation lifecycle? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [Event Manipulation] Can calling set_vault_enabled(true) then set_vault_enabled(true) again emit duplicate VaultEnabled events that confuse off-chain monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_vault_enabled()] [Reentrancy] Can set_vault_enabled() be called reentrantly through a nested transaction context to bypass vault status checks in other operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_vault()] [Version Bypass] Does upgrade_vault() have any version checks to prevent downgrading vault version or upgrading to incompatible versions that could corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_vault()] [State Preservation] Can upgrade_vault() be called while vault has active operations, positions, or requests, potentially causing those to become inaccessible or corrupted after upgrade? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_vault()] [Migration Loss] If upgrade_vault() changes vault struct layout or field types, can this cause loss of fees, shares, or asset balances that were stored pre-upgrade? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_vault()] [Multiple Upgrades] Can calling upgrade_vault() multiple times in sequence cause version counter overflow or state corruption from repeated migrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_reward_manager()] [Desync Risk] Can upgrading reward_manager while vault is active cause desynchronization between vault share accounting and reward manager receipt tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_reward_manager()] [Receipt Invalidation] Does upgrade_reward_manager() invalidate existing vault receipts or can old receipts exploit new reward_manager logic after upgrade? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_reward_manager()] [Missing Validation] Can upgrade_reward_manager() be called with mismatched PrincipalCoinType between reward_manager and vault, causing type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Price Staleness] If upgrade_oracle_config() changes oracle logic while vault operations are in progress, can stale prices be used for critical valuation decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Aggregator Corruption] Can upgrade_oracle_config() invalidate existing switchboard aggregator references causing all vault operations to fail with broken oracle? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Fee Bypass] Can set_deposit_fee() be called to 0 immediately after users submit deposit requests but before execution, allowing users to avoid fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Fee Overflow] Does set_deposit_fee() validate that deposit_fee doesn't exceed MAX_DEPOSIT_FEE_RATE cap? Can setting excessive fee cause arithmetic overflow in fee calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Retroactive Fee] If set_deposit_fee() is called between request_deposit() and execute_deposit(), which fee rate applies? Can this be exploited for front-running? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Fee Collection Loss] Can setting deposit_fee to 0 after fees are calculated but before collection cause already-computed fees to be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_deposit_fee()] [Multiple Calls] Can calling set_deposit_fee() multiple times in same transaction with different values cause fee calculation confusion or event spam? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Griefing Attack] Can admin front-run user withdraw execution by setting withdraw_fee to maximum, extracting excessive fees from users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Fee Cap Bypass] Does set_withdraw_fee() enforce MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_RATE? Can setting fee above cap cause execute_withdraw() to abort, locking user funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Asymmetric Fees] Can admin set withdraw_fee much higher than deposit_fee to create economic attack where users can't profitably exit vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_withdraw_fee()] [Fee Timing] Can changing withdraw_fee after cancel_withdraw_request() but before re-requesting allow users to lock in favorable fee rate? (Low)"
