  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Gas Griefing] Can querying a user with positions in many reserves (large reserves_count) cause excessive gas costs, enabling DoS of user state queries? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Liquidation Front-Running] Can attackers monitor get_user_state calls to identify undercollateralized positions, then front-run liquidations by viewing user health factors calculated from these balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Reentrancy During Read] If storage::get_user_balance makes external calls (unlikely but possible), can reentrancy during the loop cause the same reserve to be read multiple times with different values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Missing Access Control] The function is public and allows querying any user address - should there be privacy controls to prevent mass user position scraping by MEV bots? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Data Staleness] The returned UserStateInfo snapshot may be immediately stale after return - can consumers misuse this data for critical decisions without checking if state has changed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Storage Mutation Risk] Like get_user_state, this takes `storage_: &mut Storage` for reads only - can the mutable reference enable unintended state modifications or expose the storage to concurrent access issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Interest Rate Manipulation] The function returns supply_rate and borrow_rate from storage::get_current_rate - if rates aren't updated atomically across all reserves, can stale rates be exploited for arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Index Bounds] When calling multiple storage getter functions with `reserve_id = length - 1`, can index underflow or out-of-bounds access occur if reserves_count is manipulated to 0 during execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Supply Cap Enforcement] The function returns supply_cap from storage::get_supply_cap_ceiling - can reserves exceed their supply caps if this getter returns stale data not synchronized with actual deposit enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Borrow Cap Enforcement] The borrow_cap is retrieved via storage::get_borrow_cap_ceiling_ratio - can the 'ratio' terminology indicate this is a percentage rather than absolute cap, causing confusion in enforcement logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Index Desynchronization] The function queries supply_index and borrow_index separately - can these indices be updated non-atomically, causing the returned data to represent an impossible state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Total Supply Consistency] The function returns (total_supply, total_borrow) from storage::get_total_supply - can these values be inconsistent if one is updated before the other during concurrent transactions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Timestamp Staleness] The last_update_at timestamp is returned but not validated - can extremely stale timestamps (e.g., from paused reserves) cause interest calculation errors if not checked by consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [LTV Manipulation] The function returns LTV (loan-to-value) from storage - if LTV can be updated by admin, can stale LTV values in this getter cause liquidation threshold miscalculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Treasury Factor Bypass] The treasury_factor controls protocol fee collection - can returning this value without validation enable attackers to identify reserves with misconfigured treasury factors for exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Treasury Balance Drain] The treasury_balance is exposed - can this information help attackers target reserves with large treasury balances for governance attacks or exploits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Interest Rate Model Params] The function returns base_rate, multiplier, jump_rate_multiplier, reserve_factor, optimal_utilization - can inconsistencies between these 5 parameters cause interest rate calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Optimal Utilization Attack] If optimal_utilization is set incorrectly (e.g., > 100% or 0), can the returned data indicate this misconfiguration for attackers to exploit through rate arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Liquidation Factor Consistency] The function returns liquidation_ratio, liquidation_bonus, and liquidation_threshold - can these three values be inconsistent with each other, enabling liquidation manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Liquidation Bonus Overflow] The liquidation_bonus (incentive to liquidators) is returned as u256 - can an excessively high bonus (> 100%) cause economic attacks where liquidating is always profitable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Liquidation Threshold Bypass] If liquidation_threshold is returned stale while the actual threshold is updated, can users avoid liquidation by monitoring this getter for favorable thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Coin Type String Manipulation] The coin_type is returned as String (ASCII) - can malformed or extremely long coin type strings cause DoS or parsing errors in consuming applications? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Oracle ID Mismatch] Each reserve has an oracle_id returned from storage::get_oracle_id - can mismatches between reserve assets and their oracle IDs cause price manipulation if oracle IDs are reassigned? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Rate Update Race Condition] The supply_rate and borrow_rate are retrieved via storage::get_current_rate - if rates are computed on-demand rather than stored, can repeated calls within same transaction return different rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Reserve Factor Economics] The reserve_factor determines protocol revenue - can a reserve_factor of 0 or >100% indicate misconfiguration that breaks protocol economic security? (High)"
