  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_withdraw_amount()] [Reserve Redemption Limit] Includes reserve::max_redeem_amount() - can this be manipulated by large deposits to block withdrawals? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Multiple Functions] [Event Integrity] Events are emitted mid-function before state changes complete - can transaction revert after event emission, causing off-chain indexers to record invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Event Data] LiquidateEvent includes both repay_amount and withdraw_amount - do these match actual coins transferred, or can reserve deductions cause mismatch? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: repay()] [Ceiling Rounding] repay_amount is Decimal, then ceil() converts to u64 - can this cause user to repay more than owed if decimal precision is high? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Repay Amount Ceiling] ceil(required_repay_amount) for coin split - can this exceed max_repay_coins value, causing split to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Market Value Bound] Uses reserve::market_value_upper_bound() for rate limiting - can this be gamed when market volatility is high to borrow more than rate limiter intends? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Multiple Reserve Access] Borrows reserves vector mutably three times for repay, withdraw, then immutably twice - can this cause Rust borrow checker panic in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Reserve Modification] obligation::refresh() gets &mut reserves, then reserve is borrowed again mutably - can refresh modify reserve in way that invalidates subsequent borrow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Max Borrow Sentinel] if amount == U64_MAX, calculates max_borrow_amount() - can user pass U64_MAX by accident and borrow more than intended? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: withdraw_ctokens()] [Max Withdraw Sentinel] if amount == U64_MAX, calculates max_withdraw_amount() - does this respect rate limiter, or can it bypass rate limits by withdrawing theoretical max? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Zero Max Borrow] After calculating max_borrow_amount, asserts amount > 0 - what if user passes U64_MAX but max is 0, does it fail gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: create_obligation()] [Object Table Add] object_table::add() panics if ID already exists - can this be triggered by malicious obligation ID generation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Multiple Functions] [Object Table Borrow] Multiple functions borrow from obligations table without checking contains() first - can obligation_id not exist causing panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: new_obligation_owner_cap()] [Obligation Existence] Checks contains() before creating cap - can race condition allow obligation deletion between check and cap creation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Constant: CURRENT_VERSION] [Version 7] CURRENT_VERSION is 7 - what happened in previous versions 1-6 that required migration, and are those issues fixed? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Multiple Functions] [Version Check] Every public function checks version == CURRENT_VERSION - can this be bypassed if version field is corrupted during migration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Struct: LendingMarket] [Fee Receiver Deprecated] fee_receiver field marked deprecated but still exists - can old code still use this field to steal fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Struct: LendingMarket] [Bad Debt Unused] bad_debt_usd and bad_debt_limit_usd marked unused - does this mean bad debt is not tracked, allowing unlimited insolvency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [No Zero Address Check] receivers vector can contain address(0x0) - can fees be sent to 0x0 and lost forever? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Dynamic Field Access] Borrows FeeReceivers from dynamic_field without checking exists() first - can this panic if set_fee_receivers was never called? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Weight Manipulation] No upper bound on individual weights - can one receiver have weight = u64::MAX, getting 100% of fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: redeem_ctokens_and_withdraw_liquidity()] [Two-Step Process] Splits into request + fulfill - can liquidity_request be fulfilled from wrong reserve if indexes are manipulated? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow()] [Request Fulfillment] borrow_request() creates LiquidityRequest, then immediately fulfilled - can this be exploited if reserve state changes between request and fulfill? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: unstake_sui_from_staker()] [Liquidity Request Param] Takes &LiquidityRequest reference - can this request be used multiple times to unstake more than requested? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: add_reserve()] [Decimals Trust] Uses coin::get_decimals(coin_metadata) without validation - can fake metadata with extreme decimals (e.g., 255) break decimal math? (High)"
