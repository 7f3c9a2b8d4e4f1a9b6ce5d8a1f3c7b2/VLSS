(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [No Bounds Check] Can an attacker pass current_decimals = 255 (u8 max) to cause pow_10(255 - 18) = pow_10(237) to overflow u128 at line 148, resulting in wrapped multiplication and incorrect oracle prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Negative Value Ignored] The function only uses num.value at lines 148/150 and ignores num.neg - can this cause negative oracle price adjustments to be scaled incorrectly in absolute value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Return Type Mismatch] The function returns u128 instead of Decimal at line 146, losing the neg flag - can this cause signed price differences to be incorrectly treated as unsigned in vault calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Bidirectional Conversion Loss] If converting from 9 decimals to 18 decimals at line 148, then back to 9 decimals at line 150 in another call, can the original value be recovered exactly, or does truncation cause irreversible loss in vault price feeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: pow_10()] [Loop Overflow] Can the while loop at lines 158-161 overflow result during intermediate multiplications (e.g., result = result * 10) before the final iteration, causing silent overflow in oracle price scaling? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: pow_10()] [Maximum Safe Exponent] Since u128::max is ~3.4e38, pow_10() can safely compute up to 10^38, but is there validation that e <= 38 before calling pow_10() in scale_to_decimals(), or can exponent=39 cause overflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: pow_10()] [Zero Exponent] When e = 0, pow_10() returns 1 at line 162 without entering the loop - is this correct for scale_to_decimals() when current_decimals == DECIMALS? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: pow_10()] [Mutable Result] The result variable is mutable at line 157 - can a compiler optimization or Move VM bug cause intermediate overflow values to be silently dropped, returning incorrect power values for vault price scaling? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: pow_10()] [Counter Overflow] Can the counter i at line 156 overflow u8 if e is near 255, causing infinite loop or incorrect iteration count in pow_10() computation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: scale_to_decimals()] [Oracle Price Manipulation] If Switchboard oracle returns prices with 9 decimals and Volo Vault expects 18 decimals, can an attacker exploit rounding in scale_to_decimals() to manipulate vault total_usd_value by repeatedly triggering small conversions?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: add()] [Vault Share Inflation] When computing share prices via add() for multiple assets, can overflow in add_internal() at line 135 cause shares to wrap to a small value, enabling an attacker to mint unlimited shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: sub()] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] If vault loss_tolerance uses sub() to compute value deltas, can an attacker trigger underflow or sign errors at lines 95-111 to make losses appear as gains, bypassing loss_tolerance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/utils/decimal.move] [Function: gt()] [Health Factor Evasion] If Navi health factor checks use gt() to compare Decimal health values, can an attacker construct negative zero or overflowed values to bypass health factor limits and over-leverage their position? (Critical)",
