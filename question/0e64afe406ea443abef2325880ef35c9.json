  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Timestamp Manipulation] clock.timestamp_ms() at line 28 is used to record the update time - if the clock is manipulated, can stale values be marked as fresh? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Mismatch] If the asset_type passed at line 20 doesn't match the one passed to finish_update_asset_value() at line 28, could this cause value updates for the wrong asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Operation State] If the vault is 'during operation', does finish_update_asset_value() properly track the op_value_update_record, or can an attacker update values without marking them as updated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Value Staleness] If calculate_navi_position_value() takes time to compute (e.g., many reserves), the timestamp at line 28 might be stale compared to when prices were fetched - is this acceptable? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Partial Updates] If calculate_navi_position_value() fails midway (e.g., oracle error), does finish_update_asset_value() still get called with an incorrect partial value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Insolvency Hiding] Lines 74-76 return 0 if total_supply_usd_value < total_borrow_usd_value - does this hide the fact that the position is underwater, allowing insolvent vaults to continue operating? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Negative Equity] When total_borrow exceeds total_supply, returning 0 instead of a negative value means the vault can't track actual losses - can this be exploited for accounting manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Health Factor Bypass] If the position is underwater (line 74-76), does the health_limiter still check the Navi health factor, or is it bypassed since value is reported as 0? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Loss Detection] Returning 0 for underwater positions makes it impossible to distinguish between 'no position' and 'insolvent position' - can this cause incorrect loss_tolerance checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Liquidation Risk] If the position is underwater but reported as 0 value, will the vault think the position is empty and allow withdrawals that should be blocked? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Coin Type Mismatch] get_coin_type() at line 56 returns the type for reserve i-1 - if this type doesn't exist in the OracleConfig, will get_asset_price() at line 63 revert, DoSing the entire valuation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Type String Format] The coin_type returned at line 56 is passed to get_asset_price() at line 63 as a String - are the formats compatible, or could mismatches cause oracle lookup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Invalid Reserve] If get_coin_type() is called with an invalid reserve index (i-1 out of bounds), will it revert or return garbage data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Balance Manipulation] get_user_balance() at line 44 returns (supply, borrow) for the account - if Navi's storage is compromised, can false balances be returned to inflate position values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Balance Staleness] Are the supply and borrow balances at line 44 current, or are they stale values that don't reflect recent Navi interactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Balance Overflow] If get_user_balance() returns extremely large u256 values for supply or borrow at line 44, can subsequent ray_mul() operations at lines 53-54 overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Vault State] Does get_defi_asset() at line 20 check that the vault is in a valid state (not disabled), or can value updates occur on disabled vaults? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Existence] If the asset_type doesn't exist in the vault's asset bag, will get_defi_asset() at line 20 abort gracefully, or cause undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Generic Type Safety] The PrincipalCoinType generic must match the vault's type - if a caller provides the wrong type, will compilation or runtime checks catch this? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Borrowing] If the asset is currently borrowed for a vault operation, can update_navi_position_value() still read it via get_defi_asset(), or will it fail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Clock Injection] The Clock object is passed as a parameter at line 16 - if an attacker passes a manipulated clock object, can they affect oracle price checks or timestamp recording? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Clock Staleness] At lines 35 and 49, the clock is used - if it's not the latest system clock, can outdated timestamps affect index calculations or oracle price validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Timestamp Consistency] The clock is used multiple times (lines 35, 49, 63) - are all these calls guaranteed to return the same timestamp, or could time skew cause inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Gas Exhaustion] The loop at lines 43-72 processes all reserves - if a vault has positions in many reserves, could this exceed gas limits and make value updates impossible? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Expensive Operations] Lines 48-52 call dynamic_calculator::calculate_current_index() in every iteration - is this gas-efficient, or should static indexes be cached? (Low)"
