  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the commented-out `vault.assert_enabled()` check to perform operations on a disabled vault, bypassing the intended safety mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Status Race Condition] If `pre_vault_check()` is called concurrently from multiple transactions, can the vault status be set to VAULT_DURING_OPERATION_STATUS multiple times before any operation completes, leading to parallel operations that violate single-operation invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Loss Tolerance Bypass] If `try_reset_tolerance()` fails silently or has a bug, can an attacker perform operations that exceed the epoch loss tolerance without the tolerance being properly reset, allowing unbounded losses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Status Transition Attack] Can an attacker call functions that invoke `pre_vault_check()` without corresponding `end_op_value_update_with_bag()` to permanently lock the vault in VAULT_DURING_OPERATION_STATUS, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: pre_vault_check()] [Epoch Boundary Exploit] Can an attacker time operations at epoch boundaries to bypass tolerance reset checks, allowing loss accumulation across epoch transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a malicious operator whose OperatorCap was frozen in another operation still call `start_op_with_bag()` if the freeze check `assert_operator_not_freezed()` has race conditions or doesn't properly validate cap ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Type Confusion Attack] If `defi_asset_types` contains duplicate TypeNames or types not handled by the if-statement chain (lines 118-159), can an attacker cause assets to be borrowed but not tracked in the defi_assets bag, leading to asset loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Array Length Mismatch] While `defi_asset_ids.length() == defi_asset_types.length()` is checked, can an attacker provide malformed vectors where IDs don't correspond to types, causing `vault_utils::parse_key()` to return wrong asset keys and borrow incorrect assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Bag Key Collision] Can an attacker craft defi_asset_ids that result in identical String keys from `vault_utils::parse_key()`, causing the second `bag.add()` to fail or overwrite the first asset, leading to asset loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Missing Type Handling] If a valid DeFi asset type is added to the vault but not handled in the if-statement chain (lines 118-159), can it be borrowed from the vault but never added to defi_assets bag, allowing theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Integer Overflow] Can `principal_amount` or `coin_type_asset_amount` be set to u64::MAX causing overflow in subsequent balance operations or accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Free Principal Drain] If `principal_amount` exceeds available free principal, does `borrow_free_principal()` properly revert, or can an attacker drain more than available, affecting vault solvency? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [CoinType Asset Drain] If `coin_type_asset_amount` exceeds the vault's balance of that CoinType, can `borrow_coin_type_asset()` be exploited to borrow non-existent funds or cause underflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [USD Value Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the clock or oracle data passed to `get_total_usd_value()` to record an artificially low total_usd_value, then perform profitable operations that appear as gains instead of losses? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Share Supply Snapshot Attack] If `total_shares()` can be manipulated between the snapshot (line 179) and later share operations, can an attacker exploit share accounting discrepancies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [TxBag ID Mismatch] Can an attacker pass a vault reference but use a different vault_id in the TxBag structs, causing vault ID confusion in `end_op_with_bag()`? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Event Data Manipulation] Can incorrect data in the OperationStarted event mislead off-chain monitoring systems, hiding malicious operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [ObligationType Generic Exploit] Can an attacker provide wrong ObligationType generic parameter causing type mismatch when borrowing SuilendObligationOwnerCap, leading to borrowing wrong obligations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Balance Zero Edge Case] If both principal_amount=0 and coin_type_asset_amount=0, are zero balances properly handled in all downstream operations without causing panics or accounting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: start_op_with_bag()] [Multiple Asset ID Reuse] Can the same defi_asset_id appear multiple times in the vector, causing double-borrowing of the same asset and bag corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Asset Return Bypass] If an attacker modifies the defi_assets bag between start and end operations, can they return different assets than borrowed, stealing high-value assets? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Type Mismatch Attack] If the defi_asset_types in TxBag don't match actual types in the bag, can the remove operations fail silently or return wrong assets, leaving assets unreturned? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Vault ID Verification Bypass] Can an attacker pass a TxBag from one vault but execute end_op on a different vault, bypassing the vault_id check through ID collision or manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Incomplete Asset Return] If one of the asset types doesn't match any if-statement condition (lines 235-271), is the asset left in the bag causing `destroy_empty()` to fail, or worse, causing asset loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Principal Balance Overflow] If the returned principal_balance is larger than what was borrowed, can this cause accounting overflow and allow operators to mint principal tokens? (Critical)"
