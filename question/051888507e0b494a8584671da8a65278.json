  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Object ID Predictability] Is the oracle ID predictable based on transaction ordering? Could attackers precompute oracle IDs and prepare attacks targeting specific oracles before they're created? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Multi-Call Attack] Can enable_oracle be called in rapid succession with different parameters to cause state inconsistency, where attestations are validated against one key but the oracle uses a different key? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Attestation Spamming] Can an attacker with package-level access spam add_attestation calls with unique guardian_ids to exhaust storage or gas limits, preventing legitimate attestations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Oracle Proliferation] Can unlimited oracles be created with the same oracle_key, causing confusion about which oracle is canonical for a given data feed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Module: switchboard::oracle] [Package Boundary] Are all modules within the switchboard package trusted? Could a malicious module within the package abuse public(package) functions to compromise oracle integrity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Filter Logic Error] The filter condition is 'a.timestamp_ms + ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT_MS > timestamp_ms && a.guardian_id != attestation.guardian_id'. If ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT_MS causes overflow, the first condition becomes false and all attestations could be filtered, leaving only the new one. Is this intended? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Attestation Order] Does the order of attestations in valid_attestations matter? If processing depends on order but add_attestation always appends, could this cause issues in systems expecting most recent attestations first? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Guardian Limit] Is there a maximum number of unique guardians? If attestations from N guardians are all valid, could the vector grow without bound? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: valid_attestation_count()] [Partial Match] If multiple secp256k1_keys are similar (e.g., differ by one byte), could a bug in key comparison logic cause cross-counting of attestations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: valid_attestation_count()] [Volo Vault Dependency] If Volo Vault's health limiter checks attestation count before price updates, and an attacker can manipulate count via add_attestation spam, could they block critical vault operations like liquidations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Price Feed Manipulation] If enable_oracle can change the secp256k1_key used for price signature verification, could an attacker change it to their key, sign fake prices, and manipulate Volo Vault's asset valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: expiration_time_ms()] [Vault Operation Timing] If Volo Vault starts an operation when oracle expiration is near, and the oracle expires mid-operation, could this cause value calculation errors leading to incorrect vault shares or asset distributions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Oracle] [Queue Dependency] If the queue object referenced by queue ID is deleted or becomes unavailable, can the oracle still function? Could queue manipulation be used to DoS oracle attestation collection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Attestation-Key Mismatch] After enable_oracle changes secp256k1_key, existing attestations with the old key remain in valid_attestations. Does this create inconsistency where valid_attestation_count checks against the new key but old-key attestations exist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Timestamp Consistency] If timestamp_ms parameter is user-supplied and doesn't match actual blockchain time, could this cause attestations to be filtered incorrectly based on skewed time references? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Oracle] [Queue Key Consistency] Are oracle_key and queue_key related or independent? Could mismatched keys cause routing errors where attestations are sent to the wrong queue or oracle? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new_attestation()] [Attestation Reuse] Since Attestation has copy ability, can the same attestation struct be copied and added to multiple oracles? Would this allow a single guardian attestation to count multiple times? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Timestamp Addition Overflow] In 'a.timestamp_ms + ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT_MS', if a.timestamp_ms is greater than u64::MAX - ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT_MS (18446744073709551615 - 600000), will the addition overflow and wrap, causing incorrect expiration checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Comparison Wraparound] If overflow occurs in timestamp arithmetic, could the comparison 'a.timestamp_ms + ATTESTATION_TIMEOUT_MS > timestamp_ms' evaluate incorrectly due to wraparound, keeping expired attestations or removing valid ones? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: expiration_time_ms()] [Expiration Overflow] Can expiration_time_ms be set to u64::MAX in enable_oracle, and if so, would this effectively create a never-expiring oracle that could serve stale data indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Gas Exhaustion DoS] If an attacker fills valid_attestations with maximum entries just below expiration, could the filter operation in add_attestation consume excessive gas, preventing legitimate attestations from being added? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: valid_attestation_count()] [Query DoS] If valid_attestations contains thousands of entries, could calling valid_attestation_count become too expensive, preventing dependent systems like Volo Vault from verifying oracle validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Enablement Spam] Can enable_oracle be called repeatedly to change oracle configuration, causing observers/indexers to waste resources tracking frequent state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Oracle Creation DoS] Can an attacker create thousands of oracles to exhaust shared object storage or cause indexing issues for systems tracking oracle states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: destroy_oracle()] [Test-Only Leak] The destroy_oracle function is test_only, but if mistakenly made public, could it allow deletion of active oracles, causing loss of price feeds for Volo Vault? (Low)"
