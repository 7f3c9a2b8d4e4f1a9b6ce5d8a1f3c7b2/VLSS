  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Authorization Bypass] The AdminCap is transferred to ctx.sender() without any additional verification - could a malicious actor front-run the deployment transaction to become the admin, gaining control over package initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Access Control] The function has package visibility but no AdminCap requirement - could any module within the same package call this to set an arbitrary malicious package ID, breaking oracle integrity assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [Access Control] The function has package visibility without AdminCap verification - could a compromised or malicious co-package module overwrite the guardian_queue to point to an attacker-controlled queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [Access Control] The function has package visibility but lacks AdminCap enforcement - could any same-package module replace the oracle_queue with a malicious oracle that returns fake prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: AdminCap] [Authorization] AdminCap has key ability but is never verified in setter functions - is the AdminCap actually used anywhere in the broader package, or is it a dead capability leaving setters unprotected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Initialization] All three ID fields are initialized to zero address (0x00...00) - could the State be used before proper configuration, causing oracle/guardian lookups to fail or return invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [State Management] The State object is immediately shared without any initialization checks - could dependent contracts read the zero-address IDs and proceed with invalid oracle/guardian references? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Race Condition] State is shared and AdminCap transferred in same function - could there be a timing window where State is accessible but AdminCap hasn't been transferred, allowing unauthorized reads of uninitialized IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [Input Validation] No validation that oracle_queue_id is non-zero or points to valid oracle queue object - could setting zero address cause oracle price queries to silently fail or return stale/invalid prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [Input Validation] No check that guardian_queue_id references an actual guardian queue object - could setting invalid ID brick guardian-based security checks in dependent contracts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Input Validation] No verification that on_demand_package_id is a valid package object - could setting arbitrary ID cause package version checks or upgrade logic to fail catastrophically? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: set_oracle_queue_id(), set_guardian_queue_id(), set_on_demand_package_id()] [State Consistency] No mutual exclusion or ordering requirements between setters - could concurrent calls to multiple setters create inconsistent state where IDs reference incompatible protocol versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Public Interface] Public getter returns ID directly without validation - if oracle_queue is zero/invalid, could dependent contracts using this getter proceed with operations using invalid oracle data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: guardian_queue()] [Public Interface] Public getter has no staleness/validity checks - could consumers reading guardian_queue assume it's valid when it might be zero/outdated/compromised? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: on_demand_package_id()] [Public Interface] Getter returns package ID without version validation - could dependent logic trust this ID to implement critical security checks that might be bypassed if ID points to old/vulnerable package version? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [State Mutation] No event emission on oracle_queue change - could silent updates to oracle source allow price manipulation attacks to go undetected in dependent vaults? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [State Mutation] No event or checkpoint when guardian_queue changes - could rotation to malicious guardian compromise security without audit trail? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Upgradeability] Package ID can be mutated without version checks or migration logic - could premature package ID update break compatibility with in-flight transactions or oracle reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: set_oracle_queue_id(), set_guardian_queue_id(), set_on_demand_package_id()] [Atomicity] No atomic multi-update mechanism - if oracle protocol requires coordinated update of all three IDs, could partial updates leave system in broken state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [Shared Object] State is shared but has mutable fields - could high-frequency setter calls cause contention/congestion affecting oracle read performance in dependent contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [Object Sharing] State shared without time-lock or governance delay - could malicious package developer update IDs immediately after deployment to rug-pull users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [Immutability] State fields are mutable but no immutability enforcement after initialization - should oracle_queue/guardian_queue be frozen after first valid set to prevent governance attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Functions: set_on_demand_package_id(), set_guardian_queue_id(), set_oracle_queue_id()] [Package Boundary] All setters use package visibility - if this package is republished or has multiple modules, could any co-deployed module become attack vector for state manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Module: switchboard::on_demand] [Dependency Chain] This module is local dependency of volo-vault - could compromised deployment of parent package gain package-level access to mutate oracle/guardian IDs affecting vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Oracle Integration] Volo vault relies on this for Switchboard oracle prices - if oracle_queue returns zero/invalid ID, could vault operation value calculations use stale/zero prices leading to loss tolerance bypass? (Critical)"
