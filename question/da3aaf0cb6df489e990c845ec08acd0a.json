  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Price Oracle Manipulation] If the protocol uses price oracles, could flash loan volume manipulation affect oracle prices for downstream exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Supply Index Inflation] By taking large flash loans repeatedly, can attackers artificially inflate supply_index faster than normal to manipulate lending rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Pool Drain] Can an attacker take maximum flash loans to temporarily drain pool liquidity, causing DoS for legitimate borrowers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Gas Exhaustion] The logic::update_state_of_all() might be expensive - can attackers trigger this repeatedly via flash loans to exhaust block gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Linear Search DoS] With many assets, the O(n) search becomes expensive - can attackers add many assets to make repay() prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Config Bloat] Can an attacker create many asset configs to bloat Config storage, making all operations slower? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Receipt] [No Drop Ability] Receipt doesn't have drop ability - if a user fails to call repay(), the receipt persists, but does this lock funds or prevent cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Receipt] [No Store Ability] Receipt doesn't have store - can it be temporarily stored in objects or tables during complex operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Receipt] [No Key Ability] Receipt can't be shared objects - does this prevent certain attack vectors or enable others? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Receipt Destructuring] The receipt is destructured in repay() - if destructuring fails partway, could this leave partial state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: parsed_receipt()] [Receipt Reference] This function takes &Receipt - could an attacker use this to inspect receipts they don't own to gain information? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Config] [Shared Object] Config is shared, allowing concurrent access - could race conditions in table operations corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Config] [Version Field] The version field is manually managed - if forgotten during updates, could this cause version mismatch vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: Config] [Two Tables] Config maintains both support_assets and assets tables - if these become inconsistent, could this cause lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: AssetConfig] [Multiple Instances] Each asset has its own AssetConfig object - could an attacker create duplicate configs for same coin type in different configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Struct: AssetConfig] [Pool ID Update] If pool_id is updated after creation, existing receipts reference old pool_id - could this cause repayment failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [FlashLoanMultiple Constant] If constants::FlashLoanMultiple() returns 0, division causes panic - is there validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [FlashLoanMultiple Change] If FlashLoanMultiple() value changes between loan() and repay(), does this cause fee mismatch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: verify_config()] [FlashLoanMultiple Assumption] The function assumes FlashLoanMultiple() is constant - if it's dynamically updated, could configs become invalid? (Medium)"
