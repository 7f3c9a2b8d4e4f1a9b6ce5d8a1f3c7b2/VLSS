  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [AdminCap Cloning] If Sui allows copying capabilities (against best practices), can AdminCap be cloned and the clone used to call run(), allowing multiple parties to change oracle_queue_id? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Timelock Missing] Does run() lack a timelock mechanism requiring a delay between announcing and executing oracle_queue_id changes, allowing admin to instantly switch to malicious queue without community warning? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Multi-Sig Bypass] If the system expects multi-sig governance for admin operations, does run() enforce multi-sig requirements, or can a single AdminCap holder unilaterally change oracle_queue_id? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Admin Rotation] During admin key rotation, can the old admin call run() to set a malicious oracle_queue_id just before or during the handover, leaving the new admin with a compromised system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Race Condition] Since actuate() mutates shared State object, if two run() calls execute concurrently, can the second call read stale old_oracle_queue_id from State before the first write completes, causing incorrect event emission showing wrong old_oracle_queue_id? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Inconsistency] If actuate() is called while another transaction is reading State.oracle_queue for an oracle price query, can the mid-update state cause the query to use a partially updated or inconsistent queue ID? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] If multiple run() calls occur in the same epoch, can OracleQueueIdSet events be emitted out of order, causing off-chain systems to apply oracle queue changes in wrong sequence? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Atomicity Break] Does actuate() update State.oracle_queue before emitting the event? If the event emission fails, is the state change rolled back, or could State be left with updated oracle_queue but no event, breaking off-chain tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Transaction Revert] If on_demand::set_oracle_queue_id() aborts due to an internal error, does the event emission still occur, causing off-chain systems to believe the change succeeded when it actually reverted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Lock] Does Sui's shared object access model allow actuate() to obtain an exclusive lock on State? Can concurrent vault operations reading oracle_queue be blocked or delayed by a long-running set_oracle_queue_id transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Reentrancy] Can actuate() be exploited via reentrancy if the event emission or set_oracle_queue_id call triggers a callback to another contract that calls run() again with a different oracle_queue_id before the first call completes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Partial Update] If State contains other oracle-related fields beyond oracle_queue, can actuate() leave State in an inconsistent state where oracle_queue is updated but related fields (like cached prices or queue metadata) are stale? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Read-Your-Writes] In Sui's transaction model, if actuate() updates oracle_queue, can the same transaction immediately read the new value reliably, or could subsequent oracle queries in the same transaction see stale oracle_queue due to caching? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Forgery] Since OracleQueueIdSet event is emitted after set_oracle_queue_id call, if the set operation fails but event emission succeeds (or vice versa), can this create false signals to off-chain systems about actual state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: OracleQueueIdSet] [Information Disclosure] The OracleQueueIdSet event exposes both old and new oracle_queue_id publicly - can this information be used by MEV bots to front-run vault operations that depend on the old queue before the change takes effect? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: OracleQueueIdSet] [Timing Attack] By monitoring OracleQueueIdSet events, can an attacker time their vault deposits/withdrawals to exploit the window during oracle queue transition when price feeds might be inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spam] Can an admin repeatedly call run() with alternating oracle_queue_id values to spam OracleQueueIdSet events, overloading off-chain indexers or causing DoS on systems that process every event? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Struct: OracleQueueIdSet] [Event Parsing] Do off-chain systems properly validate that old_oracle_queue_id in events matches their cached value? Can discrepancies be exploited to confuse oracle tracking logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Metadata] Does OracleQueueIdSet event lack critical metadata like timestamp, admin address, or reason for change? Can this make security audits or incident response difficult when investigating unauthorized changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Zero Address] Can oracle_queue_id parameter be set to the zero address (0x0), and if so, does this break all downstream oracle price queries in volo-vault, causing vault operations to fail or return default/incorrect prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Deleted Object] Can oracle_queue_id reference a Queue object that was deleted or destroyed, and will subsequent oracle queries properly detect and handle this, or will they fail with unclear error messages? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Safety] Does Sui's type system prevent setting oracle_queue_id to an ID of a non-Queue object? Can an attacker pass an ID of any random object type, causing type errors in oracle resolution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Self-Reference] Can oracle_queue_id be set to State's own ID (self-reference), creating a logical error where the oracle queue points to the state object itself? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Invalid ID Format] Can oracle_queue_id be constructed with invalid bytes or malformed address format that Sui accepts but causes downstream parsing failures? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/state/set_oracle_queue_id_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Package ID] Can oracle_queue_id reference a Queue from a different Switchboard package version, causing version incompatibility issues in oracle price queries? (Medium)"
