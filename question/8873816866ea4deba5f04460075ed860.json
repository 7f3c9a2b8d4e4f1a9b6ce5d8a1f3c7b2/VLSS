  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Receiver Validation] Checks vectors have same length and total_weight > 0 - can empty receivers vector or zero-weight entries cause division by zero in claim_fees()? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: set_fee_receivers()] [Dynamic Field Override] Old FeeReceivers is removed before adding new - can this cause fees to be lost if set_fee_receivers is called during claim_fees? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Fee Calculation] Uses u128 math: (total_fees * weight) / total_weight - can this overflow if total_fees is near u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Last Receiver Rounding] Last receiver gets withdraw_all() to handle rounding - can this give significantly more/less than fair share if many receivers exist? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Zero Balance Handling] Checks if balance > 0 before transfer - can this fail if balance calculation results in 0 due to rounding, leaving dust in contract? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Entry Function] Marked as entry fun - anyone can call this, triggering fee distribution - can this be griefed by repeatedly calling before significant fees accumulate? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: init_staker()] [Staker Initialization] Only checks reserve is SUI type - can staker be initialized multiple times with different TreasuryCaps, breaking staking invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: rebalance_staker()] [Rebalancing] No owner check - anyone can call rebalance_staker() - can this be abused to manipulate staking state or cause DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: unstake_sui_from_staker()] [Conditional Return] Returns early if reserve is not SUI type - can this cause issues if liquidity_request expects SUI but gets nothing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: reserve_array_index()] [Linear Search] Slow O(n) search for reserve by type - can attacker add many reserves to make this prohibitively expensive, causing DoS on operations requiring index lookup? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: reserve_array_index()] [Not Found] Returns vector length if not found - can this be exploited by passing non-existent type to cause out-of-bounds access later? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Multiple Functions] [Array Index Validation] Multiple functions use reserve_array_index without bounds checking before vector::borrow_mut() - can index >= length cause panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: obligation()] [View Function] Public view function returns &Obligation without authorization - can off-chain attackers use this to analyze obligation state for profitable liquidation timing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: compound_interest()] [Standalone Compounding] Public function allows anyone to compound interest for any reserve - can this be griefed to compound at unfavorable times for users? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_liquidity_and_mint_ctokens()] [Compound Timing] Interest is compounded before minting ctokens - can this be exploited to mint ctokens at artificially high/low ratios? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Double Compounding] Both obligation::refresh() and reserve::compound_interest() are called - can this cause interest to compound twice in same transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: borrow_request()] [Refresh Side Effects] obligation::refresh() modifies obligation state - does this update deposited/borrowed amounts such that subsequent borrow calculation is based on post-refresh values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: withdraw_ctokens()] [Stale Oracle Allowed] exist_stale_oracles flag is passed to withdraw() but not asserted - can withdrawal proceed with stale oracles, violating health factor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: liquidate()] [Refresh Timing] obligation::refresh() is called before liquidation calculation - can attacker frontrun this to update prices favorably for themselves? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Multiple Functions] [Reward Zeroing] obligation::zero_out_rewards_if_looped() is called after operations - what defines 'looped' and can attacker avoid this to keep accruing rewards unfairly? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: deposit_ctokens_into_obligation_by_id()] [Reward Loss] zero_out_rewards_if_looped() after deposit - can innocent users lose rewards by making normal deposits if they have outstanding borrows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Rate Limiter Min] min(remaining_outflow_usd, decimal::from(1_000_000_000)) caps at $1B - is this a hard cap that could block legitimate large borrows? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Fee Adjustment] Complex fee calculation with ceiling - if fee calculation rounds up by 1, max_borrow_amount -= 1 - can this cause off-by-one errors allowing overborrow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Multiple Minimums] Takes minimum of three values (obligation limit, reserve limit, rate limiter limit) - can one being 0 block all borrows even if others allow it? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_withdraw_amount()] [Ctoken Ratio Division] floor(rate_limiter_max / ctoken_ratio) - can this underflow to 0 when ctoken_ratio is very high due to interest accrual? (Medium)"
