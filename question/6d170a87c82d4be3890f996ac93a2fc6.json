  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Package Impersonation] Can attacker deploy a package that implements same interfaces as Switchboard but returns manipulated data, then point on_demand_package_id to it to impersonate legitimate oracle? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [All Setters] [Flash Loan Attack Amplification] Can attacker use flash loan to manipulate oracle IDs during a single transaction, perform vault operations with manipulated prices, then restore IDs before transaction ends? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Cross-Chain Bridge Price Attack] If Volo uses oracle prices for cross-chain bridging or LST conversions, can manipulated oracle queue enable arbitrage or theft across chains? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [No Min/Max ID Check] The setter accepts any ID value without bounds checking - can extremely large or special address values cause integer overflow in consuming code that performs arithmetic on IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [Self-Assignment] Can guardian_queue be set to State object's own ID, creating self-reference that breaks guardian logic assuming external guardian? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [System Package Assignment] Can on_demand_package_id be set to system package IDs (0x1, 0x2, etc.) causing package verification to incorrectly trust system modules as oracle sources? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Null ID Handling] If oracle_queue returns zero address, how does consuming code handle it - does it fail gracefully or treat zero as valid causing logic errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: init()] [No Setup Verification] After init() completes, there's no verification that setters were called to configure valid IDs - can State remain in uninitialized state indefinitely causing oracle failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [No Idempotency] Setter can be called repeatedly with different values - can rapid-fire setter calls cause state thrashing where consuming code sees constantly changing IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [No Freeze Mechanism] State can be mutated forever with no way to freeze configuration - can this enable perpetual manipulation risk even for mature deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_guardian_queue_id()] [No Rollback Protection] If guardian queue update breaks oracle system, there's no automatic rollback - can this cause extended downtime until manual intervention? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: oracle_queue()] [Identical ID Collisions] If oracle_queue and guardian_queue accidentally set to same ID, will consuming code fail or silently accept guardian=oracle violating separation of concerns? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: on_demand_package_id()] [Package Deletion] If on_demand_package_id points to a package that gets deleted or marked invalid, can this cause all oracle operations to fail with no recovery path? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_on_demand_package_id()] [Upgrade ID Targeting] Can this setter be used to point to specific package versions to exploit known vulnerabilities in older Switchboard versions while appearing to use legitimate package? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [All Functions] [Gas Griefing] Since State is shared and setters are package-visible, can malicious package module repeatedly call setters in every block to grief legitimate oracle users with failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Struct: State] [No Integrity Hash] State stores IDs but no hash/signature to verify configuration integrity - can this make it impossible to detect if State has been tampered with? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: set_oracle_queue_id()] [No Commit-Reveal] IDs are set immediately without commit-reveal - can MEV bots observe setter transactions and front-run Volo operations that will use new oracle? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/on_demand.move] [Function: guardian_queue()] [No Signature Verification] Guardian queue ID returned without any signature proving it's legitimate - can this enable impersonation attacks if consuming code doesn't verify guardian authenticity? (Medium)"
