  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [No Deactivation] This module only creates queues but has no deactivation logic - if a guardian queue is compromised, can it be disabled, or does it remain active indefinitely polluting the oracle space? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Immutable Parameters] Once created, can queue parameters like min_attestations or oracle_validity_length_ms be updated, or are malicious queues permanent? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spamming] Since anyone can call run() and emit GuardianQueueCreated events, can an attacker flood the event stream to DoS off-chain indexers or hide legitimate queue creation in noise? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering] If multiple queues are created in the same transaction or block, does event ordering guarantee correct tracking, or could race conditions cause off-chain systems to miss queues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Address Conversion] object::id_from_address(@0x0) performs address-to-ID conversion - could this conversion be unsafe or produce unexpected IDs in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Confusion] If queue_key vector contains unexpected byte patterns, could it cause type confusion when deserialized or used as a map key elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Atomic Creation] Is queue creation atomic? If the system crashes between queue::new() and event emission, could there be orphaned queues or inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Consistency Check] No verification that the returned queue_id matches expected properties - could queue::new() return an incorrect ID that doesn't match the queue_key? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Time Travel] If oracle_validity_length_ms is very small (1ms) and system clocks are not perfectly synchronized, could timestamp mismatches cause valid oracle data to be rejected as stale? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Epoch Sensitivity] Does queue creation depend on current epoch? If so, could queues created near epoch boundaries have inconsistent behavior or fail validation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Key Format] The queue_key is raw bytes with no validation - should it be a hash, public key, or specific format? Could arbitrary bytes cause security issues in key comparison or signing operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Key Entropy] If queue_key has low entropy or is predictable, could attackers generate collisions to hijack queue lookups or impersonate legitimate queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Upgrade Path] If this module is upgraded to add access controls, can existing malicious queues created via the old permissionless version remain active and exploit the system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Governance Bypass] If protocol governance expects to control queue creation, does this permissionless entry point bypass intended governance processes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running] Can an attacker observe pending queue creation transactions and front-run them to create a queue with the same key but malicious parameters, griefing the legitimate creator? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [MEV Extraction] Could validators/searchers profit by reordering queue creation transactions to ensure their malicious queue is created first and becomes the canonical one? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [KYC Bypass] If the protocol requires KYC/AML for queue operators, does this permissionless creation bypass those requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Audit Trail] Are queue creations logged sufficiently for audit/compliance? Could an attacker create queues that are hard to trace back to them? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Set] The hardcoded true flag might indicate this is a guardian queue - if true means 'is_guardian', does this allow anyone to create guardian-level privileged queues? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Hierarchy] If guardian queues are meant to validate other queues, can creating rogue guardian queues break the trust hierarchy and allow attacker-controlled oracles to appear legitimate? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Data Integrity] The event contains queue_id and queue_key but not other parameters - could off-chain systems reconstructing queue state from events have incomplete information leading to desync? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Persistence] Are all parameters passed to queue::new() stored in the queue object? If not, could important settings be lost, making queue behavior unpredictable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Replay Attack] If queue_key is reused across different networks or forks, could the same queue creation be replayed on multiple chains, causing confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Nonce Missing] No nonce or counter prevents creating identical queues - could this be exploited in cross-chain or multi-environment scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/guardian_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Mismatch] If the queue module expects different parameters in a future version, could calling this init action create incompatible queues that fail in unexpected ways? (Medium)"
