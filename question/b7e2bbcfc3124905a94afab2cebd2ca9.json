  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_interest_rate()] [Rate Overflow] Can new_borrow_rate or new_supply_rate exceed u256::max() bounds checking, and will subsequent ray_mul with these rates cause overflow in interest calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_interest_rate()] [Negative Rate] Can new_supply_rate exceed new_borrow_rate, violating fundamental invariant that borrow rate must exceed supply rate, draining protocol reserves? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_interest_rate()] [No Bounds] Are new rates validated against reasonable bounds (e.g., < 1000% APR), or can extreme rates cause user panic and bank run on protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Index Manipulation] Can new_borrow_index or new_supply_index be set to values less than previous index, allowing reversion of interest accrual and theft of earned interest? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Index Overflow] Can new indexes be set to values near u256::max() causing ray_div operations to fail or underflow when calculating user balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can last_update_timestamp be set to future timestamp, blocking future interest accruals that check for timestamp advancement? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Treasury Inflation] Can scaled_treasury_amount be added without corresponding borrow interest being collected, inflating treasury beyond actual protocol earnings? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Atomic Update Failure] Can update_state() be called multiple times with different parameters before update_interest_rate(), causing rate/index mismatch and incorrect interest accrual? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/portal/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: update_state()] [Cross-Reserve Contamination] Can update_state() for one asset affect global storage state used by other assets, causing cross-reserve interest corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: init_reserve()] [Oracle ID Collision] Can multiple reserves be initialized with same oracle_id, causing all to use same price feed and create correlation risk where price manipulation affects multiple assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: get_oracle_id()] [Oracle ID Mutability] Is oracle_id immutable after init_reserve(), or can it be changed later to point to manipulated price feed for existing reserve? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 45, 159] [Oracle ID Range] Can oracle_id be set to u8::max() (255) or other out-of-bounds values that don't correspond to valid oracle feeds, causing price lookup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: get_oracle_id()] [Public Access] Does public get_oracle_id() allow attackers to enumerate all oracle IDs and identify which external price feeds to target for manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: get_reserves_count()] [Count Manipulation] Can reserves_count be out of sync with actual reserves table size if reserves are added/removed, causing iteration errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: get_user_balance()] [Stale Balance] Does get_user_balance() return scaled balance or current balance after index application, and can stale scaled values mislead callers about actual withdrawable amount? (Medium)"
