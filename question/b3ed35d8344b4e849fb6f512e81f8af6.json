  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Reward Frontrunning] If user A's claim transaction is in mempool, can attacker B front-run with their own claim to drain IncentiveBal.balance before A's claim executes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Griefing via Frequent Updates] Anyone with lending module access can call update_reward repeatedly - can attacker spam updates causing all users' claims to fail due to gas exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Reward Dilution Attack] Creator can add new pools with same asset but later start times - can this dilute existing stakers' rewards by fragmenting reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Last Claimer Advantage] If IncentiveBal.balance runs low, early claimers get full rewards while later claimers get nothing - is there fairness mechanism to prevent race-to-claim scenarios? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Whale Concentration] If single user has 99% of supply_balance, they receive 99% of rewards - can whale stake briefly before reward period ends, claim all rewards, then unstake? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: PoolInfo] [Vector Index Bounds] 10+ parallel vectors (coin_types, start_times, etc.) must stay synchronized - if any operation modifies one vector without others, can this cause index out-of-bounds panics? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Table Initialization Leak] Lines 169-171: three new tables created per pool - if add_pool is called thousands of times, can table storage costs become prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: Incentive] [Owner/Admin Table Growth] owners and admins tables can grow unboundedly - can attacker convince creator to add many addresses causing table lookup degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Redundant Table Operations] Lines 208-211 remove then add to same table - can this cause unnecessary gas consumption or state transition errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Friend: lending_core::lending] [Friend Function Abuse] update_reward is friend-callable - if lending module is compromised, can it call update_reward with malicious parameters to corrupt reward state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Storage Module Dependency] Lines 251, 273 call storage::get_total_supply and get_user_balance - if Storage module has bugs, can incorrect values cause reward miscalculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Module: math::ray_math] [Ray Math Precision] ray_div and ray_math::ray() are used extensively - if ray_math has rounding errors, can accumulated precision loss cause significant reward discrepancies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Module: math::safe_math] [Safe Math Overflow Behavior] Line 255 uses safe_math::mul - does safe_math panic on overflow or return max value? Can this cause unexpected transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Module: utils::utils] [Split Coin Validation] Line 174: utils::split_coin_to_balance - if this function doesn't validate amount <= coin.value(), can it panic or return incorrect balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Friend: lending_core::incentive_v2] [Migration Risk] incentive_v2 is a friend module - can it access and corrupt incentive state during migration, causing fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Pool Exhaustion] If distributed_amount reaches total_supply, all future claims fail at line 332 assertion - can early claimers lock out later users permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Oracle ID Manipulation] oracle_id is used to price rewards but not validated on pool creation - can creator set wrong oracle_id to artificially inflate reward value calculations in external systems? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Account Parameter Injection] account parameter is passed from lending module without validation - can malicious lending call inject arbitrary addresses to corrupt user-specific reward tracking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: IncentiveBal] [Asset ID Mismatch] IncentiveBal.asset must match pool's asset ID, but no runtime validation enforces this - can mismatched IncentiveBal drain wrong pool's balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Stale Index Rewards] If update_reward is not called for long periods, index_rewards can become stale - can this cause sudden massive payouts when finally updated, draining entire pool? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Claim After Pool End] Users can claim after end_time has passed - if pool balance was refilled after end_time, can users claim more than originally allocated total_supply? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Reward Coin Source] reward_coin parameter can be from any source - can attacker add pool with malicious coin type that has transfer hooks causing reentrancy? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: set_owner() & set_admin()] [Event Emission Only] Functions only emit events but don't enforce any downstream permission checks - can owner/admin status be purely cosmetic with no actual privilege enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Zero Duration Window] If start_time == end_time after clamping, time_diff is 0 but no rewards are accrued - can attacker manipulate timestamps to prevent rewards for specific time windows?
