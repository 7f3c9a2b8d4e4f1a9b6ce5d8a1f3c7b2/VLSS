  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [MR Enclave Validation] Is mr_enclave compared against a whitelist of approved TEE measurements? Can arbitrary mr_enclave values be set, allowing attestations from compromised or simulated enclaves? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [State Consistency] If enable_oracle() is called while valid_attestations contains entries, should those attestations be cleared? Can stale attestations from a previous oracle configuration persist and be incorrectly validated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Oracle] [Initial State] In new(), expiration_time_ms is set to 0. Does this mean the oracle is disabled by default? Could dependent systems mistakenly use an uninitialized oracle before enable_oracle() is called? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Reentrancy] If enable_oracle() can be called within a complex transaction that also reads oracle state, could there be ordering issues where attestations are validated against the old key but processed against the new configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Input Validation] Is oracle_key validated for uniqueness across all oracles? Can duplicate oracle_keys be created, causing ambiguity in which oracle should be used for a given data feed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Empty Keys] Can oracle_key or queue_key be empty vectors? Would this cause issues in dependent systems that expect valid key identifiers for routing or verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Queue Validation] Is the queue ID validated to point to an existing queue object? Can arbitrary IDs be used, causing oracles to reference non-existent or malicious queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Queue Key Mismatch] Is there validation that queue_key actually corresponds to the queue ID? Could mismatched queue and queue_key parameters cause verification failures or routing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new_attestation()] [Guardian Validation] Is guardian_id validated to correspond to an actual guardian object? Can fake guardian IDs be used to create attestations that appear legitimate but bypass guardian verification? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new_attestation()] [Key Format] Is secp256k1_key validated to be a valid 33-byte compressed or 65-byte uncompressed secp256k1 public key? Can invalid key formats cause signature verification to fail or accept malformed signatures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new_attestation()] [Timestamp Source] Where does timestamp_ms come from in production? If it's user-supplied, can attackers manipulate it to bypass attestation expiration checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Copy Ability] Attestation has 'copy' ability. Can attestations be duplicated and reused across multiple oracles or contexts, enabling replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Drop Ability] Attestation has 'drop' ability. Can critical attestations be accidentally dropped without proper accounting, leading to loss of guardian approvals? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Version Check] VERSION is set to 1 but never validated in any function. Can oracles with different versions coexist, causing compatibility issues when newer code expects different struct layouts? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: version()] [Upgrade Path] The version accessor is public but there's no upgrade mechanism. How will oracle objects be migrated if VERSION changes in the future? Could old version oracles cause issues if not properly handled? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Oracle] [Immutable Fields] Are oracle_key, queue, and queue_key intended to be immutable after creation? If so, why aren't they validated as constants throughout the oracle's lifecycle to prevent tampering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: new()] [Shared Object] Oracle is shared via transfer::share_object. Can concurrent transactions cause race conditions when multiple parties try to add_attestation or enable_oracle simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Concurrent Modification] If two transactions filter and modify valid_attestations concurrently based on the same initial state, could one transaction's changes be lost when the other commits, leading to attestation loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: enable_oracle()] [Race Condition] Can enable_oracle and add_attestation be called in the same block? If enable_oracle changes the secp256k1_key while add_attestation is executing, could attestations be added for the wrong key? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Filter Cost] The vector::filter! operation iterates all valid_attestations. If the vector grows large, could the gas cost exceed transaction limits, causing DoS where new attestations can't be added? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: valid_attestation_count()] [Iteration Cost] vector::count! iterates all attestations. With many attestations, could querying the count become prohibitively expensive, blocking dependent systems from verifying oracle validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Vector Growth] Is there a maximum size for valid_attestations? Could unbounded growth eventually make the Oracle object too large to fit in transaction limits? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Guardian Replacement] The filter removes existing attestations with matching guardian_id. If a guardian's key is compromised and needs to be rotated, does this mechanism properly handle key rotation without allowing both old and new keys to attest? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Function: add_attestation()] [Key Inconsistency] Can the same guardian_id attest with different secp256k1_keys over time? If so, does valid_attestation_count correctly handle cases where the oracle's current key differs from historical attestation keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/schemas/oracle.move] [Struct: Attestation] [Guardian Identity] Is guardian_id intended to be the on-chain object ID of a guardian? If guardians are off-chain entities, how is the mapping between guardian_id and actual guardian identity verified? (Medium)"
