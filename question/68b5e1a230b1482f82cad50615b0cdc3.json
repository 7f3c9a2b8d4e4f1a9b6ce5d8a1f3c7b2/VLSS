(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Inheritance] Does the new queue inherit oracles from guardian_queue, or start with empty existing_oracles table, potentially creating unusable queue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Activity] Does validate() check if guardian_queue is active and has recent oracle submissions, or can attacker reference abandoned guardian queue?

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Public Entry Abuse] Since run() is public entry, can any user create queues that reference the official guardian_queue, impersonating official protocol queues?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Duplicate Queue Detection] Can the same queue_key be used to create multiple queues, and if so, how are they distinguished when oracles try to submit to 'the queue with key X'?
