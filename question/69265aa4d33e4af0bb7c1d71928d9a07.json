  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: collect_fee()] [Version Check Timing] collect_fee calls assert_version before transfer. If version is outdated, can fee collection fail, locking fees in pool permanently? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: collect_fee()] [Pause During Fee Collection] collect_fee checks when_not_paused. If pool is paused after fees accumulate but before collection, can fees remain locked until unpause? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: collect_fee()] [Zero Fee Collection] If collectable_fee value is 0, collect_fee still transfers empty coin. Can repeated zero-value calls spam FeeCollectedEvent without cost? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_collected_rewards()] [Collected Rewards Manipulation] mut_collected_rewards returns mutable reference to collected_rewards. Can external package module set collected_rewards to arbitrary value, manipulating get_total_rewards and ratio calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_pending()] [Pending Balance Theft] mut_pending returns mutable reference to pending Coin<SUI>. Can external package module extract pending SUI without going through stake/unstake logic, stealing user funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_validator_set()] [Validator Set Corruption] mut_validator_set returns mutable reference to validator_set. Can external package module add malicious validators or manipulate stake distribution without proper authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Double Cap Creation] mark_cap_created adds CAP_CREATED dynamic field and aborts if it exists. Can an attacker bypass by removing dynamic field first, then calling mark_cap_created to allow duplicate cap creation? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Abort Without Error Code] mark_cap_created aborts with code 0 if CAP_CREATED exists. Can this generic abort code mask the true error, confusing diagnostics? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Package-level functions] [Authorization Bypass] All package-level mutation functions (mut_*) don't check OwnerCap or OperatorCap. Can malicious package modules in the same package namespace call these to bypass all authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: change_min_stake()] [Deprecated Config Lock] change_min_stake aborts with E_DEPRECATED but min_stake is used in stake validation. Can inability to update min_stake lock users out if initial value is too high? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: change_base_reward_fee()] [Fee Lock] change_base_reward_fee is deprecated, locking base_reward_fee at init value (10%). Can inability to adjust fees as market conditions change cause protocol revenue loss? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: update_rewards()] [Reward Update Disabled] update_rewards is deprecated, preventing operator from updating total_rewards. Can stale reward values cause ratio to drift from actual pool value, enabling arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake()] [Entry Point Disabled] stake entry function is deprecated but stake_non_entry_for_testing exists. Can users mistakenly call deprecated entry point, losing gas without execution? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Validator Update Lock] update_validators is deprecated, preventing operator from rebalancing validator set. Can inactive or malicious validators remain in set indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: test_update_version()] [Version Manipulation] test_update_version allows setting arbitrary version without migration. If test functions are exposed in production, can an attacker downgrade version to re-enable deprecated functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: change_staked_value()] [Staked Manipulation] change_staked_value allows setting arbitrary total_staked for any epoch. If exposed in production, can an attacker set total_staked to 0 to hyperinflate ratio? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake_non_entry_for_testing()] [Test Function Entry] stake_non_entry_for_testing has full stake logic with min_stake check but marked test_only. Can accidental exposure allow direct stake without proper entry point validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake_pool_for_testing()] [Stake Pool Test Version] stake_pool_for_testing has different logic than original stake_pool (tickets_supply check). Can divergent test implementation hide bugs in production code? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_for_testing()] [Test Unstake Path] unstake_for_testing calls mint_ticket_non_entry and burn_ticket_non_entry directly. Can this bypass any entry-point-specific validation in deprecated unstake function? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_pending()] [Pending in Total Staked] get_total_staked adds pending to total_staked[epoch]. If pending is large and never staked, can this inflate total_staked in ratio calculation without actual validator stake? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Pending Consumed First] unstake always consumes pending before touching validator stakes. Can an attacker force large pending balance before unstake to avoid triggering validator unstaking and associated fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake_pool_for_testing()] [Pending Below Threshold] stake_pool_for_testing only stakes if pending >= ONE_SUI after ticket_supply deduction. Can pending remain < ONE_SUI indefinitely, accumulating as dead balance? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Pending Balance Reentry] After unstaking excess, the function joins it back to pending and calls stake_pool. Can this create reentrancy if stake_pool triggers another operation? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_ratio()] [Ticket Supply Subtraction] Ratio denominator subtracts ticket_supply. Can an attacker mint max tickets to reduce denominator to near-zero, hyperinflating ratio? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake_pool_for_testing()] [Ticket Supply Reserve] stake_pool reserves tickets_supply worth of SUI in pending before staking. If ticket_supply > pending, function returns without staking. Can high ticket supply permanently block staking? (High)"
