  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Logic: Downgrade Prevention] No version comparison logic exists. Could a malicious operator downgrade the protocol to a vulnerable version, reintroducing patched exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Logic: Skip Detection] Could version upgrades skip numbers (1.0 -> 1.5 -> 2.0), leaving gaps that break assumptions in dependent code expecting sequential versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Access Control: Public Functions] All version query functions (value_major, value_minor) are public but abort. If made functional, could unrestricted public access leak version information useful for exploit timing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Access Control: Upgrade Functions] Upgrade functions are public entry points requiring VersionCap. If made functional without additional checks, could this allow automated bots or scripts to perform upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Access Control: set_version Override] set_version allows arbitrary version setting with only VersionCap. Could this bypass the intended major/minor upgrade flow, allowing jumps to incompatible versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Adaptor Safety] If Cetus, Navi, Suilend, or Momentum adaptors call version functions for safety checks, could the abort cause adaptors to fail, preventing all DeFi interactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Vault Core] If vault core operations call assert_supported_version at startup, could this create a complete denial of service where no vault operations can execute? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Request Processing] If deposit/withdraw request processing verifies version compatibility, could users' requests be permanently stuck in pending state due to abort? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Math Libraries] If MMT v3 math functions depend on version checks for selecting appropriate algorithms, could the abort cause wrong math to be used, leading to calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Oracle Integration] If Switchboard oracle price validation uses version checks to ensure compatible data formats, could the abort cause price feed failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Health Factor] If health limiter checks MMT version before calculating Navi health factors, could the abort prevent health checks, allowing over-leveraged positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Fee Config] If fee configuration updates verify MMT version for basis point calculation compatibility, could the abort prevent fee updates, locking in potentially exploitative fee rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Cross-Module: Validator Pool] If liquid staking validator pool operations check MMT version, could the abort affect staking/unstaking flows even though they shouldn't depend on AMM versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [State: Version Singleton] If Version is supposed to be a singleton shared object, but init aborts, could multiple Version objects be created through exploits, causing version check inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [State: Mutation Atomicity] If upgrade functions were functional, could partial failures leave Version in an inconsistent state with only major OR minor updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [State: Race Conditions] If concurrent transactions call upgrade functions, could race conditions result in lost updates or corrupted version state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Error: Abort Semantics] All aborts use code 0. In Move, is abort 0 distinguishable from other errors? Could this mask the root cause when debugging transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Error: Missing Constants] No error constants like EVersionTooOld, EUnauthorized exist. Would adding these improve error clarity if functions were implemented? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Error: Stack Traces] Do Move stack traces identify which function aborted? If not, could uniformly using abort 0 make it impossible to identify failing functions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Documentation: Missing Comments] No doc comments explain the module's purpose or why functions abort. Could this indicate rushed development or placeholder code? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Documentation: Function Signatures] Function signatures suggest clear intent (upgrade_major, assert_supported_version) but implementations contradict this. Could this confusion lead to integration errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Documentation: TODO Markers] No TODOs or FIXMEs exist. Could this indicate the stub is intentional rather than incomplete? If so, what is the intended use case? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Migration: From volo_v1] If Volo Vault migrates from volo_v1 and expects MMT v3 version checks, could the stub cause migration transactions to abort, preventing users from accessing v2 features? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Migration: Version Bumps] If protocol upgrades require version bumps, could the non-functional upgrade_major/minor prevent the protocol from signaling breaking changes to integrators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Migration: Backward Compatibility] If the protocol needs to maintain backward compatibility with old versions, could lack of version tracking allow incompatible old code to interact with new deployments? (High)"
