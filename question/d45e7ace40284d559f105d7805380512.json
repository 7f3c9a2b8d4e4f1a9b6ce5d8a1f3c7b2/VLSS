  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Generic Type Safety] PrincipalCoinType generic at line 13 - if caller instantiates with wrong coin type that doesn't match vault's actual principal, can this bypass type safety and corrupt vault accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Reentrancy] Function calls external vault.get_defi_asset() at line 20, then calculate_navi_position_value(), then vault.finish_update_asset_value() at line 28 - can attacker reenter between these calls to manipulate vault state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [State Consistency] Line 28 calls finish_update_asset_value() with calculated usd_value - if vault state changed between line 20 (get_defi_asset) and line 28, can stale value update violate vault's invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [External Call Risk] Function makes multiple external calls (storage.get_user_balance, storage.get_coin_type, vault_oracle::get_asset_price, dynamic_calculator) - can any of these be reentered or manipulated to return inconsistent data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Atomicity] Function updates single asset value at line 28 but vault may have multiple Navi positions - can attacker update positions selectively to create inconsistent total vault valuation snapshot? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Negative Position Handling] Lines 74-76 return 0 if total_borrow > total_supply (underwater position) - does vault correctly handle 0 value for positions with actual assets, potentially allowing vault to operate as if no collateral exists? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Zero Reserve Count] Line 37 initializes i from get_reserves_count() - if reserves_count is 0, loop never executes and function returns 0 at line 78, can attacker exploit empty vault state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Zero Price Handling] If vault_oracle::get_asset_price() returns 0 at line 63 (e.g., oracle failure), mul_with_oracle_price() returns 0 at lines 65-66 - can attacker exploit zero-priced assets to hide debt or inflate collateral value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Zero Index] If supply_index or borrow_index from dynamic_calculator is 0 at lines 48-52, ray_mul() returns 0 - can this zero out legitimate supply/borrow, allowing attacker to avoid debt accounting? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Zero Value Update] If calculate_navi_position_value() returns 0 at line 21-26, finish_update_asset_value() sets asset value to 0 - can this allow operations that should be blocked by insufficient collateral? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Account Owner Mismatch] Line 22 uses account_cap.account_owner() address - if AccountCap was somehow transferred or owner changed, can wrong account's position be used to value vault assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Address Validation] Function accepts arbitrary account address at line 32 with no validation - can attacker pass zero address, contract address, or other invalid address to cause undefined behavior in storage lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Account Balance Race] storage.get_user_balance() called at line 44 - if Navi storage updates user balance during multi-reserve loop, can this create inconsistent snapshot where some reserves use old balance and others new? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Timestamp Precision] Line 28 calls clock.timestamp_ms() - if clock is in past or future due to manipulation, can stale timestamp bypass vault's update timing checks allowing outdated valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Index Calculation Timing] dynamic_calculator::calculate_current_index() at line 48 uses clock - if called during block boundary or epoch transition, can indices be calculated inconsistently for different reserves in same loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Stale Value Update] No check that calculated value is recent - if calculate_navi_position_value() takes long time (many reserves), can value be stale by time finish_update_asset_value() is called at line 28? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Storage Corruption] Storage parameter is &mut at line 34 - if storage is corrupted or in inconsistent state during iteration, can function return arbitrary values that don't reflect actual positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Reserve Count Manipulation] Line 37 trusts storage.get_reserves_count() - if this can be manipulated to return inflated count, can loop access invalid reserve indices causing panics or wrong data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [User Balance Corruption] If storage.get_user_balance() at line 44 returns corrupted supply/borrow values (e.g., supply < actual supply), can this undervalue position and trigger liquidation of healthy position? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Vault State Dependency] Function depends on vault.get_defi_asset() at line 20 and vault.finish_update_asset_value() at line 28 - if vault is in invalid state (e.g., during operation), can update corrupt vault's accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: update_navi_position_value()] [Asset Not Found] If asset_type doesn't exist in vault at line 20, get_defi_asset() may panic - can attacker trigger DoS by calling with invalid asset_type repeatedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Navi Protocol Mismatch] Function assumes Navi storage structure - if Navi protocol upgrades storage layout or reserve indexing, can calculations become completely incorrect without detecting the mismatch? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Oracle Config Mismatch] OracleConfig at line 34 may not have prices for all coin types in Navi - if reserve exists but oracle config lacks price, does get_asset_price panic at line 63 or return 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Ray Math Precision] Lines 53-54 use ray_math::ray_mul() which uses 27 decimal places - if supply/borrow values are very small, can rounding to zero eliminate non-zero positions from valuation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/navi_adaptor.move] [Function: calculate_navi_position_value()] [Index Scaling Error] ray_mul() at line 53-54 assumes indices use ray scaling (1e27) - if Navi uses different scaling (e.g., 1e18), can this cause 1 billion x misvaluation of all positions? (Critical)"
