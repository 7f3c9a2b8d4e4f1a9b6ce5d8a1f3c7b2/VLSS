  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: zero()] [Critical DoS] All public functions contain 'abort 0' causing immediate transaction failure - if any Volo vault operation depends on i64 arithmetic, can an attacker trigger vault operations requiring signed integer math to permanently DoS the entire vault system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: from_u64()] [Critical DoS] Function aborts unconditionally - if vault price calculations or adaptor position tracking use from_u64() to convert unsigned balances to signed values, can all vault deposits/withdrawals be permanently blocked? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Critical DoS] Addition operation aborts unconditionally - if vault PnL calculations or adaptor balance reconciliation require signed addition, can an attacker force all vault operations into permanent failure state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Critical DoS] Subtraction operation aborts unconditionally - if vault loss calculations or fee deductions use signed subtraction, can all vault accounting operations be permanently disabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: mul()] [Critical DoS] Multiplication operation aborts unconditionally - if vault share price calculations or adaptor leverage ratios require signed multiplication, can an attacker brick all vault math operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: div()] [Critical DoS] Division operation aborts unconditionally - if vault APY calculations or adaptor position sizing use signed division, can all vault performance tracking be permanently disabled? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: cmp()] [Critical DoS] Comparison operation aborts unconditionally - if vault health checks or adaptor risk limits compare signed values, can an attacker prevent all vault risk management from functioning? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: neg_from()] [Critical DoS] Negative number creation aborts unconditionally - if vault loss tracking or adaptor debt accounting requires negative value representation, can all vault loss scenarios become unhandleable? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: abs()] [Critical DoS] Absolute value operation aborts unconditionally - if vault tolerance checks or adaptor position magnitude calculations use abs(), can all vault safety checks be bypassed through DoS? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: mod()] [Critical DoS] Modulo operation aborts unconditionally - if vault epoch calculations or adaptor periodic settlement logic require modulo with signed values, can all time-based vault operations fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Integer Overflow] Test shows add(MAX_AS_U64, 1) should abort - if implemented without overflow check and vault PnL accumulation adds maximum positive value + 1, can an attacker cause silent overflow wrapping to minimum negative value, falsely showing catastrophic loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Integer Underflow] Test shows add(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64), neg_from(1)) should abort - if implemented without underflow check and vault loss tracking adds minimum negative + negative 1, can silent underflow wrap to maximum positive, hiding total vault insolvency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: wrapping_add()] [Wrapping Overflow] Test shows wrapping_add(MAX_AS_U64, 1) wraps to MIN_AS_U64 - if vault uses wrapping addition for PnL and attacker causes MAX profit + 1 gain, can wrapping to MIN cause vault to report maximum loss instead of overflow, enabling attacker to steal all funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: wrapping_add()] [Silent Underflow] If vault uses wrapping_add for loss accumulation and two large negative values wrap past minimum, can the vault silently report positive balance when actually insolvent, allowing continued operations despite insolvency? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Positive Overflow Edge] Test validates add(MAX_AS_U64-1, 1) == MAX_AS_U64 succeeds but add(MAX_AS_U64, 1) aborts - if vault PnL calculation is at exactly MAX-1 and receives 2 units of profit, does missing boundary check allow overflow into negative range? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Negative Underflow Edge] Test validates add(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64-1), neg_from(1)) == MIN_AS_U64 succeeds but next step aborts - if vault loss tracking is at MIN+1 and suffers 2 units loss, can missing boundary check cause underflow? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Mixed Sign Addition] Test shows add(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64), from(1)) works correctly - but if implementation error treats MIN_AS_U64 incorrectly due to sign bit, can adding small positive to minimum negative cause unexpected overflow behavior in vault reconciliation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: add()] [Zero Boundary] Tests show add(0,0), add(0,positive), add(0,negative) all work - but if implementation has special-case bug for zero handling and vault PnL starts at exactly zero, can first profit/loss update cause arithmetic error? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Subtraction Overflow] Test shows sub(MAX_AS_U64, neg_from(1)) should abort - if vault calculates profit = currentValue - (-debt) and currentValue is MAX, can subtracting negative (equivalent to adding positive) overflow into negative range, showing false loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Subtraction Underflow] Test shows sub(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64), from(1)) should abort - if vault calculates loss = currentValue - benchmark where currentValue is minimum negative, can subtracting positive underflow past representable range? (High)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Self Subtraction] Tests show sub(MAX, MAX) == 0 and sub(MIN, MIN) == 0 - but if implementation has floating point-style precision loss at extremes, can vault PnL calculation of position - position return non-zero when should be zero? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: sub()] [Sign Flip in Subtraction] Test shows sub(from(1), from(1000000)) correctly returns negative - but if implementation incorrectly handles sign bit during borrow in subtraction, can vault balance calculations show wrong sign when withdrawals exceed deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i64.move] [Function: mul()] [Multiplication Overflow] Test shows mul(MIN_AS_U64/2, from(1)) and mul(neg_from(MIN_AS_U64/2), neg_from(2)) should abort - if vault share price calculation multiplies large position size by leverage factor without overflow check, can attacker trigger overflow to wrap to opposite sign value?
