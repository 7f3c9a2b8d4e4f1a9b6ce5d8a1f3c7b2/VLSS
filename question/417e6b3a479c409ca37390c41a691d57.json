  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker create a ReserveConfig with open_ltv_pct=100 and close_ltv_pct=100, allowing 100% LTV ratios that enable over-collateralized positions to be considered healthy when they should be liquidatable, potentially causing protocol insolvency? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Invariant Violation] Can open_ltv_pct be set equal to close_ltv_pct (e.g., both 80%), eliminating the liquidation buffer and causing positions at exactly 80% LTV to oscillate between healthy and liquidatable states, enabling griefing or liquidation front-running? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Parameter Validation] Can close_ltv_pct be set equal to max_close_ltv_pct with both at 100%, allowing positions to remain open at maximum LTV during volatile market conditions, increasing liquidation cascade risk? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Accounting Error] Can borrow_weight_bps be set to exactly 10_000 (100%), causing borrowed assets to have no risk premium in weighted borrow calculations, potentially underestimating position risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Integer Overflow] Can liquidation_bonus_bps + protocol_liquidation_fee_bps be set to exactly 2_000 (20%), and when combined with actual liquidation discounts, could this cause arithmetic overflow in liquidation value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Logic Error] The validation allows liquidation_bonus_bps <= max_liquidation_bonus_bps, but does not validate that liquidation_bonus_bps + protocol_liquidation_fee_bps also respects this relationship - can this cause liquidation_bonus_bps to be valid individually but exceed the combined cap when fees are added? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Isolation Mode Bypass] For isolated assets with open_ltv_pct=0 and close_ltv_pct=0, can an attacker still use the asset as partial collateral through cross-reserve interactions if the isolation check is only enforced at config creation but not during actual borrowing operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Fee Cap Violation] Can borrow_fee_bps be set to exactly 10_000 (100%), causing all borrow amounts to be doubled in fee calculations, potentially causing borrowers to owe more than their collateral value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Fee Cap Violation] Can spread_fee_bps be set to exactly 10_000 (100%), causing supply APR to become zero regardless of borrow APR, breaking the incentive model for depositors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Limit Ordering] Can open_attributed_borrow_limit_usd equal close_attributed_borrow_limit_usd, eliminating the buffer for attributed borrows and causing positions at exactly the limit to be immediately liquidatable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Array Bounds] Can an attacker create interest_rate_utils with exactly 2 elements [0, 100], minimizing validation checks while creating a linear interest curve that may not properly incentivize utilization management? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Monotonicity Violation] The validation allows APRs to be equal (monotonically increasing, not strictly increasing) - can consecutive identical APR values at different utilization points create confusion in rate calculations or enable APR manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Edge Case] If utils = [0, 99, 100] and aprs = [1000, 1000, 50000], the jump from 99% to 100% utilization increases APR by 50x - can this extreme rate jump cause borrowers at 99.9% utilization to face unexpectedly high interest, leading to instant liquidation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Vector Length Mismatch] The validation ensures length(utils) == length(aprs), but if both are exactly 2, does this provide insufficient granularity for interest rate curves, potentially causing suboptimal capital efficiency? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Boundary Validation] The validation requires utils[0] == 0 and utils[length-1] == 100, but does not check if intermediate values are valid percentages (0-100) - can utils = [0, 255, 100] pass validation due to u8 wraparound? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Integer Overflow] Can aprs vector contain extremely large u64 values near u64::MAX that would cause overflow when converted to Decimals or used in multiplication operations during APR calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Strict Inequality] The utils must be strictly increasing, but if utils = [0, 50, 51, 100], the gap between 50 and 51 is minimal - can this cause precision loss in linear interpolation calculations within calculate_apr? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Input Validation] The function asserts cur_util <= 1.0, but what if cur_util is negative due to an underflow in the calling context? Could negative utilization cause the while loop to never find a matching interval and trigger the assertion failure at line 239? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Division By Zero] In the weight calculation div(sub(cur_util, left_util), sub(right_util, left_util)), if left_util == right_util due to a malformed config that bypassed validation, can this cause division by zero and transaction abort? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Loop Bounds] The loop starts at i=1 and continues while i < length, checking intervals [i-1, i] - if the cur_util falls exactly on a boundary point that matches left_util or right_util in multiple intervals, which interval is selected and could this cause inconsistent APR calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Unreachable Code] The function has an assertion at line 239 that should never execute - if this code is reached, it indicates a logic error. Can an adversary craft a cur_util value that is <= 1.0 but does not fall into any interval, bypassing all if conditions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Decimal Precision Loss] When calculating weight = (cur_util - left_util) / (right_util - left_util), if the interval is very small (e.g., 0.001%), can precision loss cause the calculated APR to be significantly different from the expected linear interpolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Boundary Condition] If cur_util equals exactly left_util (e.g., 0%), the weight becomes 0 and the function returns left_apr - but if cur_util equals right_util (e.g., 100%), the weight becomes 1 and returns right_apr. Can edge rounding cause cur_util=100.0000001% to fail the <= check and not match any interval? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [APR Overflow] When computing left_apr + weight * (right_apr - left_apr), if right_apr and left_apr are both near the maximum representable Decimal value, can the multiplication or addition overflow, causing transaction abort or incorrect APR calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Utilization Edge Case] If the reserve is at exactly 100% utilization and utils = [0, 80, 100], the cur_util=100% should match the interval [80%, 100%] and return the maximum APR - but if decimal comparison precision causes ge(cur_util, left_util) to be false for the last interval, could this trigger the unreachable assertion? (High)"
