  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Lines: 1161-1165] [Conditional Transfer] If balance > 0 transfers else destroys zero balance - can destroy_zero fail if balance somehow becomes non-zero between check and destroy? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: init_staker()] [SUI Reserve Required] Requires reserve coin_type == SUI but doesn't check if staker already initialized - can double-initialization corrupt state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: init_staker()] [Treasury Cap] Takes TreasuryCap<S> but type S is not validated against reserve - can wrong treasury cap be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: rebalance_staker()] [No Authorization] No cap requirement so publicly callable - can attacker repeatedly rebalance to grief protocol or manipulate staking? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: rebalance_staker()] [System State] Takes &mut SuiSystemState - can rebalance be front-run during epoch boundaries to extract value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: unstake_sui_from_staker()] [Conditional Return] Early returns if coin_type != SUI without error - can this cause silent failures in batch operations? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Lines: 815-817] [Silent Failure] Returns early if not SUI reserve without reverting - can caller assume success when operation actually skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Struct: LendingMarket<phantom P>] [Phantom Type] P is phantom but used for type safety - can two LendingMarkets with different P values interact unsafely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Struct: ObligationOwnerCap<phantom P>] [Cap Type Mismatch] Cap has phantom P but obligation_id is untyped ID - can cap with wrong P be used with obligation of different market? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Struct: RateLimiterExemption<phantom P, phantom T>] [Type Enforcement] Has drop ability so can be discarded - should it be consumed to ensure exemptions aren't wasted? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_borrow_amount()] [Triple Min] Takes min of obligation max, reserve max, and rate_limiter max - can one constraint being 0 hide more informative error from others? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market.move] [Function: max_withdraw_amount()] [Triple Min] Same issue - can 0 from rate limiter hide health factor issue? (Low)",
