  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_amount_x_delta()] [Missing Implementation] If Volo Vault's Cetus CLMM adaptor or any AMM integration calls this function expecting liquidity/price calculations, will all transactions abort with code 0, causing complete denial of service for AMM-related vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_amount_y_delta()] [Missing Implementation] If vault operations depend on computing token amount deltas from sqrt price ranges for rebalancing or position management, will the abort 0 implementation cause vault operations to fail and freeze user funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_next_sqrt_price_from_amount_x_rouding_up()] [Missing Implementation] If price calculation for token swaps or liquidity additions relies on this function, will all such operations abort, preventing vault adaptors from executing DeFi strategies? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_next_sqrt_price_from_amount_y_rouding_down()] [Missing Implementation] If vault position value updates or withdrawal calculations require computing next sqrt prices from amount Y, will the abort cause value calculation failures and incorrect share pricing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_next_sqrt_price_from_input()] [Missing Implementation] If Cetus or other CLMM adaptors use this for computing price impact during swaps, will all swap operations through vault adaptors fail with abort 0? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Function: get_next_sqrt_price_from_output()] [Missing Implementation] If vault operations computing output amounts from desired price movements rely on this function, will strategic rebalancing operations be impossible, exposing vault to impermanent loss without mitigation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Module Level] [Dependency Risk] If this stub module was intended for testing but accidentally deployed to production, are there any runtime checks in calling modules that detect the abort condition before user funds are affected? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/utils/sqrt_price_math.move] [Module Level] [Integration Risk] Has the Volo Vault team verified that no production vault adaptors (Cetus, Momentum, or other AMM integrations) actually invoke any functions from this module? (High)"
