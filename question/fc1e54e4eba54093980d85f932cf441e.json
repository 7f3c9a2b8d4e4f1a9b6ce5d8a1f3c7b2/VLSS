  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Module Inconsistency] If other queue action modules (queue_set_configs_action, queue_override_oracle_action) have different authority checks, can an attacker exploit version or authority inconsistencies across modules? Precondition: Multiple action modules with varying checks. Violated invariant: Authority enforcement should be consistent. Impact: Bypassing restrictions via module switching. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Dependency Vulnerability] If the queue module's has_authority() implementation is buggy or exploitable, does this action inherit those vulnerabilities? Precondition: has_authority() is flawed. Violated invariant: Authority checks must be secure. Impact: Complete authority takeover via dependency exploit. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Upgrade Risk] If the queue module is upgraded with a breaking change to has_authority() or set_authority() signatures, can this action module break or behave unexpectedly? Precondition: Incompatible module upgrade. Violated invariant: Modules should maintain interface compatibility. Impact: Authority transfer failures, undefined behavior. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [State Corruption] If queue.set_authority() fails to properly update internal data structures (e.g., authority mapping tables), can the Queue become corrupted with mismatched authority states? Precondition: set_authority() has bugs. Violated invariant: Authority updates must be complete and consistent. Impact: Queue corruption, broken access control. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call run() with small gas amounts to cause transaction failures that partially consume the Queue's state resources? Precondition: Shared Queue object, low gas limits. Violated invariant: Operations should complete or revert cleanly. Impact: DoS via gas griefing. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Flooding] Can an attacker rapidly transfer authority back and forth to themselves, flooding the event system with QueueAuthorityUpdated events and impacting indexers?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Storage Bloat] If Queue tracks authority change history and run() can be called unlimited times, can an attacker bloat storage with redundant authority transfers? Precondition: Queue logs authority history. Violated invariant: Storage growth should be bounded. Impact: Storage exhaustion, increased costs. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Privilege Escalation] If Queue authority controls critical oracle operations, can an attacker who temporarily gains authority (through social engineering, key compromise) permanently lock out the original authority by transferring to themselves? Precondition: Attacker gains temporary authority access. Violated invariant: Authority transfers should be recoverable. Impact: Permanent oracle takeover. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Lateral Movement] Can a compromised low-privilege queue be used as a stepping stone to change authority on high-value queues if they share validation logic or authority checks? Precondition: Multiple queues with shared validation. Violated invariant: Queues should be isolated. Impact: Cross-queue privilege escalation. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Impersonation] If has_authority() relies on tx signatures and an attacker can forge or replay signatures, can they impersonate the authority? Precondition: Weak signature verification. Violated invariant: Authority must be unforgeable. Impact: Complete authority takeover via signature forgery. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [State Machine Violation] If Queue has lifecycle states (e.g., active, paused, deprecated) not checked in validate(), can authority be transferred when Queue is in invalid state? Precondition: Queue has state machine, no state checks. Violated invariant: Authority transfers should respect Queue lifecycle. Impact: Authority changes in invalid states. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Finality Issues] If Queue is being destroyed or deprecated in parallel, can run() succeed and set a new authority on a Queue about to be deleted? Precondition: Queue destruction concurrent with authority change. Violated invariant: Authority changes should not occur on queues being destroyed. Impact: Wasted operations, state inconsistency. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Authority Manipulation] Given this is a Switchboard oracle queue, can changing authority to a malicious actor allow them to manipulate oracle feeds, affecting Volo Vault price calculations? Precondition: Queue controls oracle data. Violated invariant: Oracle authority should be trusted. Impact: Oracle manipulation, incorrect vault valuations. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cross-Protocol Impact] If Volo Vault depends on this oracle queue for price feeds and authority is compromised, can an attacker manipulate vault operations through fraudulent prices?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Timestamp Manipulation] If validate() or actuate() rely on block timestamps for any time-based checks (not visible in current code), can validators manipulate timestamps to bypass restrictions? Precondition: Time-based validation exists. Violated invariant: Time checks should be manipulation-resistant. Impact: Bypassing time locks or cooldowns. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Cooldown Bypass] If Queue should enforce a cooldown between authority changes (not implemented here), can rapid successive calls to run() bypass intended security delays? Precondition: No cooldown enforcement. Violated invariant: Authority changes should be rate-limited. Impact: Rapid authority cycling attacks. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Error Code Confusion] Can EInvalidAuthority and EInvalidQueueVersion error codes be confused or misinterpreted by calling code, leading to incorrect error handling? Precondition: Callers check error codes generically. Violated invariant: Error codes should be distinct and unambiguous. Impact: Incorrect error responses, security bypasses. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assertion Failure] What happens if assert!() calls fail? Do they leave the Queue in a partially-modified state or rollback cleanly? Precondition: Assertions fail. Violated invariant: Failures should rollback all state changes. Impact: Potential state corruption on assertion failures. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Exception Safety] If actuate() throws an unhandled exception after validate() succeeds, is there a window where validation passed but update didn't occur, confusing calling code? Precondition: actuate() can throw exceptions. Violated invariant: run() should be exception-safe. Impact: Inconsistent execution states. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Visibility Exploit] validate() is marked public—can external contracts call it directly to check authority without modifying state, then exploit timing windows between check and actual use? Precondition: validate() is public. Violated invariant: Validation should be atomic with action. Impact: TOCTOU (Time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerabilities. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Visibility Risk] actuate() is marked private (fun, not public fun)—if it were accidentally made public in a future change, could it be called without validation? Precondition: Visibility accidentally changed. Violated invariant: actuate() must remain private. Impact: Validation bypass. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_authority_action.move] [Function: run()] [Entry Function Restrictions] run() is marked public entry—does this restrict it to being called only as a transaction entry point, or can it be called from other contracts? Precondition: Entry function semantics misunderstood. Violated invariant: Entry functions should have clear call restrictions. Impact: Unexpected call patterns, potential exploits. (Low)"
