  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Stale Oracle Detection] The valid flag is returned but not interpreted - if valid=false, do consuming contracts properly reject the price data or could they use stale/invalid prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Position Monitoring] Since user positions are publicly queryable, can MEV bots use this to identify profitable liquidations, front-running legitimate liquidators? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Total Supply vs Cap] If total_supply exceeds supply_cap in returned data, does this indicate an exploit has occurred or a race condition in cap enforcement? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Utilization Calculation] The function returns total_supply and total_borrow separately - can calculating utilization (borrow/supply) result in division by zero if supply is 0 but borrow > 0? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Data Snapshot Timing] All three functions return point-in-time snapshots - can consumers misuse these snapshots for critical decisions in subsequent transactions where state has changed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Array Length] If the ids vector is extremely long (1000+ elements), can the function exceed computational limits or return incomplete data? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Multi-Reserve Health] The function returns balances across all reserves but doesn't compute health factor - can consumers incorrectly calculate health by not accounting for different LTVs per asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Index Growth Bounds] The supply_index and borrow_index can grow unbounded - can extremely large indices (near u256 max) cause overflow in balance calculations when multiplied with principal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Rate Calculation Dependency] The current_rate depends on utilization which depends on total_supply and total_borrow - can race conditions cause these to be inconsistent, returning impossible rate values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [No Emergency Controls] The module has no pause or emergency shutdown mechanism - should getter functions be disabled during protocol emergencies to prevent information leakage? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Multiple Oracle Queries] Each oracle ID is queried independently - can this enable price manipulation if attacker controls multiple oracle IDs and can set different prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Address Validation] The user address parameter is not validated - can querying special addresses (0x0, module addresses) expose internal protocol state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Treasury Accumulation] If treasury_balance grows very large, can it indicate fee extraction vulnerabilities or protocol revenue being locked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Coin Type Collision] The coin_type is returned as ASCII String - can two different assets have the same coin type string, causing asset confusion in UIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Module: getter] [Version Compatibility] This is in lending_ui module - if lending_core storage schema changes, can this getter module return corrupted or outdated data structure formats? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_reserve_data()] [Jump Rate Model] The jump_rate_multiplier triggers above optimal_utilization - can attackers force utilization just above optimal to benefit from lower jump rates before they fully apply? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_oracle_info()] [Oracle Price Zero] If oracle::get_token_price returns price=0 with valid=true, can this zero price be used to manipulate vault asset valuations to zero? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/getter.move] [Function: get_user_state()] [Borrow Position Inversion] If a user has borrow_balance > supply_balance (undercollateralized), does this function properly indicate this state for liquidation detection? (High)"
