(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive_v2.move] [Function: add_funds()] [Authorization Check] Does OwnerCap requirement prevent malicious users from directly calling add_funds with minimal value and causing IncreasedFunds events that could confuse off-chain monitoring systems?
