  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: pair_id_to_vector()] [Address Format] Does sui::address support all possible u256 values when converting from_u256()? Can some u32 pair IDs fail to convert properly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: vector_to_pair_id()] [Byte Padding] If vectors have leading or trailing padding bytes, does from_bytes() strip them correctly, or can they affect the final pair_id calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Functions: pair_id_to_vector() + vector_to_pair_id()] [Canonical Form] Is the vector<u8> representation canonical? Could there be multiple vector representations for the same pair_id, causing storage lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Oracle State] If OracleHolder's internal state is updated mid-transaction (e.g., new price pushed while get_price() is executing), can this cause inconsistent reads or race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Atomic Price-Timestamp] Are price and timestamp guaranteed to be from the same oracle update? Can they be from different updates if oracle state changes during execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Multiplication Overflow] In to_target_decimal_value_safe(), when multiplying price by 10 repeatedly (price = price * 10), can this overflow u256 for very large initial prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Division Underflow] When dividing price by 10 repeatedly (price = price / 10), can this underflow to zero prematurely for small initial prices, causing incorrect valuations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: pair_id_to_vector()] [U256 Overflow] When casting u32 to u256, can any arithmetic in from_u256() overflow, even though u32::MAX fits easily in u256? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Same Decimal] If decimal == target_decimal, does to_target_decimal_value_safe() immediately return without any conversion, or does it perform unnecessary operations that could introduce errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: vector_to_pair_id()] [Max U32] If vector represents u32::MAX (4,294,967,295), does the conversion handle this boundary correctly, or can it wrap to 0 or cause errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: pair_id_to_vector()] [Zero Pair ID] What happens when pair=0 is converted to vector? Is this a valid pair ID in Supra oracle, or does it represent an uninitialized/invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Price Feed Types] Does Supra oracle support different feed types (spot, TWAP, aggregated)? Can get_price_native() return different price types that should be handled differently by the vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_native()] [Multi-Hop Pairs] If a pair involves multi-hop price calculations (e.g., A/B via A/C and C/B), does get_price_native() receive the final computed price, or raw prices that need additional math? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Price Units] Does the price represent amount of quote per base, or base per quote? Can confusion about units cause inverted prices (1/price instead of price)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Functions: pair_id_to_vector() + vector_to_pair_id()] [Roundtrip Testing] Has roundtrip testing verified that for all u32 values, vector_to_pair_id(pair_id_to_vector(x)) == x? Are there known values where this fails? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Function: get_price_to_target_decimal()] [Conversion Testing] Has decimal conversion been tested for all combinations of source and target decimals (0-255)? Are there untested edge cases that could fail in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Integration Testing] Has this module been integration tested with the actual Supra oracle on-chain, or only with mocks? Can real oracle behavior differ from test assumptions? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Sui Framework Dependency] Does this module rely on sui::address functions that might have bugs or unexpected behavior in edge cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/adaptor_supra.move] [Module Level] [Oracle Governance] If Supra oracle governance maliciously updates OracleHolder or price feeds, can this module detect and reject malicious data, or does it blindly accept any values from OracleHolder?
