  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Schema Evolution] If Aggregator struct schema changes between versions (new fields added in v2), does aggregator.delete() at line 26 properly destruct all fields, or can v1 deletion leave v2 fields undestroyed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Security Patch] If version 1 has a critical security flaw fixed in version 2, does forcing EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION=1 mean this deletion action perpetuates the vulnerability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Version Constant Immutability] Is EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION a compile-time constant preventing runtime upgrades, meaning protocol must redeploy entire module to support v2 deletions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Bitmap Check] If version should support bitmask flags (e.g., version 1 | PAUSED_FLAG), does simple equality check at line 18 miss flag bits, allowing paused aggregators to be deleted? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Version Event Confusion] Does AggregatorDeleted event at lines 23-25 include version field to distinguish v1 vs v2 deletions, or can event listeners confuse deletion types leading to incorrect off-chain state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering Attack] Event is emitted at line 27 AFTER aggregator.delete() at line 26—if delete() fails, is event::emit() still called due to lack of proper error propagation, causing false deletion events? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Data Integrity] AggregatorDeleted event at lines 13-15 only includes aggregator_id—should it also include authority, timestamp, and version for audit trail, or can missing data enable attacker to delete without proper logging? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Replay Protection] Can an attacker capture AggregatorDeleted event and replay it to off-chain systems to falsely indicate multiple deletions of the same aggregator, causing oracle price feed confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Order] Is it correct to call aggregator.delete() at line 26 before emitting event at line 27, or should event emit first to ensure event is captured even if delete() partially fails? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Field Immutability] Does AggregatorDeleted use aggregator.id() at line 24 which might return a reference to already-deleted object after aggregator.delete(), causing event to contain invalid/stale ID? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Timestamp Missing] AggregatorDeleted event at lines 13-15 lacks timestamp—can this prevent Volo Vault from determining when aggregator was deleted, causing stale price data to be used post-deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Event Emission Failure] If event::emit() at line 27 fails due to gas exhaustion or network issues, does the transaction revert, ensuring deletion doesn't happen without event, or can silent event failure occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Indexing Attack] Can attacker delete and recreate aggregators rapidly, causing event spam that overloads off-chain indexers monitoring AggregatorDeleted events for Volo Vault oracle management? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Before Delete] Should update_event be constructed at line 23-25 before calling aggregator.delete() at line 26 to capture aggregator state, but current code calls aggregator.id() which might be invalid post-delete? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Atomicity] Is event emission at line 27 guaranteed to be atomic with aggregator.delete() at line 26, or can transaction failures create split-brain where aggregator is deleted but event isn't emitted or vice versa? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Schema Version] Does AggregatorDeleted event include a schema version field to handle future event format changes, or will old event parsers break when event structure evolves? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Listener DoS] Can an attacker delete many aggregators in single transaction, emitting thousands of AggregatorDeleted events that DoS event listeners or indexers monitoring for Volo Vault oracle updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Event-Driven State Sync] If Volo Vault relies on AggregatorDeleted event to remove aggregator from OracleConfig, can event processing delays cause vault to continue using deleted aggregator, reading stale/zero prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Signature Verification] Does AggregatorDeleted event include cryptographic signature to prove it originated from legitimate deletion, or can attacker emit fake events to confuse off-chain systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Cost Attack] Can attacker exploit event emission cost to make deletion prohibitively expensive, effectively preventing legitimate authorities from deleting old aggregators, causing storage bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Sequence Gap] If multiple run() calls occur concurrently, can AggregatorDeleted events be emitted out of sequence, causing off-chain systems to process deletions in wrong order and corrupt oracle state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Struct: AggregatorDeleted] [Event Retention Policy] How long are AggregatorDeleted events retained, and can attacker delete aggregators knowing events will be pruned before Volo Vault audits deletion history? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Conditional Emission] Should event be emitted only if aggregator.delete() succeeds, but current code at lines 26-27 emits unconditionally—can this cause event/state mismatch? (High)",
