  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Missing Field] No deadline or max_execution_time - could requests become stale if vault conditions change significantly, and operator has no obligation to execute within reasonable time? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Missing Field] No request_status enum (pending/executed/cancelled) - how is double-execution prevented and could operator execute same request twice if request is not deleted from Table? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Missing Field] No signature or authorization proof - how is request authenticity verified and could attacker forge requests if Table access is compromised? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Missing Field] No nonce or unique salt - could identical requests (same amount, receipt_id, etc.) at different times be confused or subject to replay attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Concurrency] The struct is stored in Table which allows concurrent access - could parallel execute_deposit calls on same request_id cause double-execution before Table.remove completes? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Concurrency] Request creation and coin buffering are separate operations - could MEV searcher frontrun between request_deposit adding request to Table and adding coin to buffer, causing inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Concurrency] Multiple operators could call execute_deposit concurrently - without atomic check-and-delete, could race condition allow multiple executions of same request? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Concurrency] The request_id comes from auto-incremented counter - could concurrent request_deposit calls receive same request_id if counter update is not atomic, causing request_id collision? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Concurrency] The recipient field could reference Receipt object that's transferred mid-flight - could receipt ownership change between request_deposit and execute_deposit cause shares to be credited to wrong owner? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Economic Attack] The expected_shares is fixed at request time - could attacker manipulate vault share price after request but before execution to cause guaranteed slippage violation, griefing honest users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Economic Attack] Large pending deposits in buffer could be frontrun - could attacker observe pending amount via getter, deposit just before execution to dilute shares, then immediately withdraw? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Economic Attack] The locking_time_for_cancel_request creates cancellation window - could attacker spam requests then cancel strategically to grief vault operations and waste operator gas? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Economic Attack] No minimum time before execution - could operator immediately execute request without giving user time to cancel, enabling forced execution at unfavorable share price? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: amount()] [Economic Attack] Public amount getter enables MEV - could sandwich attackers monitor pending deposits and manipulate vault value to extract value from large deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: expected_shares()] [Economic Attack] Public expected_shares getter reveals user's slippage tolerance - could attacker extract maximum slippage by manipulating vault state to boundary of expected_shares constraint? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Data Integrity] The amount field can diverge from actual coin value - if coin is removed or modified in deposit_coin_buffer, how is amount field kept in sync and could this cause theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Data Integrity] The receipt_id field stores address but Receipt object could be destroyed - could dangling receipt_id reference cause execute_deposit to fail permanently, locking coins? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Data Integrity] The vault_id field stores address but Vault object could be destroyed or upgraded - could stale vault_id reference cause request execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Data Integrity] No checksum or hash of critical fields - could struct corruption or bit flips in storage cause unexpected behavior during execution? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Data Integrity] The expected_shares is calculated at request time - if vault's share calculation logic changes (upgrade), could stale expected_shares always fail causing permanent coin lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Type Safety] The struct has no generic type parameter for principal coin - how is type safety enforced between request and Vault<T>, and could type confusion allow cross-coin-type exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Function: new()] [Type Safety] The constructor accepts addresses without type witnesses - could attacker pass addresses of wrong type objects that pass address equality checks but fail dynamic borrows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Type Safety] No runtime type checking in getter functions - could type confusion if DepositRequest is cast from raw bytes or transferred between incompatible contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Upgrade Risk] The struct layout has no version field - could adding/removing fields in future upgrades break compatibility with pending requests in Table? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/deposit_request.move] [Struct: DepositRequest] [Upgrade Risk] No migration path for old requests - if struct definition changes, how are pending requests handled and could they become unexecutable? (Medium)"
