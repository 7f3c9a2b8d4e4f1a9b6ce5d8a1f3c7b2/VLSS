  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Loop Complexity] The calculate_apr function loops through interest rate segments (minimum 2, no maximum enforced) - if an attacker creates a config with 1000 segments, can this cause excessive gas consumption and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Loop Complexity] The validation loops through all utils/aprs elements - if vectors have 1000+ elements (no upper bound enforced), can config creation consume excessive gas and fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: build()] [Multiple Bag Operations] The build() function performs 18 bag::remove operations - each operation has gas costs. Can this make config updates prohibitively expensive, preventing parameter adjustments during market stress? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: set()] [Generic Constraints] The set<K, V> function requires K: copy + drop + store and V: store + drop - but does not require V: copy. Can this cause issues if a non-copyable value is stored and later needs to be duplicated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: set()] [Key Collision] The set() function uses byte string keys (e.g., b",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Missing Checks] The validation does not check if liquidation_bonus_bps alone exceeds a reasonable threshold (e.g., 1_000 or 10%) - can excessive liquidation bonuses (e.g., 19% with 1% protocol fee) make liquidations too profitable, encouraging unnecessary liquidations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Missing Checks] The validation does not enforce a maximum for borrow_weight_bps - can weights like 1_000_000 BPS (100x) cause borrowed amounts to be overweighted by 100x, breaking risk calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_reserve_config()] [Missing Checks] The validation does not check relationships between token limits and USD limits - if deposit_limit is 1M tokens but deposit_limit_usd is $100, which limit takes precedence? Can limits conflict? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: validate_utils_and_aprs()] [Missing Checks] The validation ensures utils is strictly increasing but does not enforce minimum spacing - if two consecutive utils differ by only 1 (e.g., [0, 1, 100]), can this cause precision issues in interpolation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_supply_apr()] [Spread Fee Impact] High spread fees reduce supply APR - if spread_fee_bps is 9_000 (90%), suppliers only receive 10% of the borrow interest. Can this drive away deposits and cause liquidity crunch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Rate Jump] If interest rate increases sharply at high utilization (e.g., 1% APR at 90% util, 1000% APR at 95% util), can borrowers be caught off-guard and liquidated due to sudden rate increases? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: liquidation_bonus()] [Liquidation Incentive] If liquidation_bonus_bps is too low (e.g., 10 BPS or 0.1%), liquidations may not be profitable enough to attract liquidators, risking protocol bad debt during market crashes. Is there a minimum threshold? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: protocol_liquidation_fee()] [Protocol Revenue] If protocol_liquidation_fee_bps is 0, the protocol earns nothing from liquidations - combined with low borrow/spread fees, can this make the protocol economically unviable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Constants] [Error Codes] The module defines only two error codes: EInvalidReserveConfig (0) and EInvalidUtil (1) - using the same error code for multiple validation failures makes debugging difficult. Can error specificity be improved? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/reserve_config.move] [Function: calculate_apr()] [Panic Message] The unreachable assertion at line 239 triggers with error code EInvalidReserveConfig, making it indistinguishable from config validation failures. Can this confuse users about the actual error? (Low)"
