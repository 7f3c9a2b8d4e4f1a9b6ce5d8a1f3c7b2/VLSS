  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Market Value Calculation] Do reserve::ctoken_market_value and reserve::market_value use consistent pricing, or can discrepancies between cToken and underlying pricing be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Empty Obligation] If an obligation has no deposits and no borrows (empty vectors), will the loops not execute and return 0 / DECIMAL = 0, which might be correct or might hide errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Timestamp Manipulation] The function passes clock.timestamp_ms() to finish_update_asset_value - can an attacker manipulate the clock object to affect staleness tracking or loss tolerance calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Scaled Value Conversion] What if to_scaled_val() uses a different scaling factor than DECIMAL, causing a mismatch when dividing by DECIMAL at the end? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Reserve Index Out of Bounds] Can deposit.reserve_array_index() or borrow.reserve_array_index() return indices outside the reserves vector bounds, causing a panic or accessing wrong reserves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [Duplicate Indices] If the same reserve_array_index appears in both deposits and borrows, will it be added twice to array_indices, causing double compounding in suilend_compound_interest? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Index Validation] Does lending_market.compound_interest validate that reserve_array_index is valid, or can invalid indices from get_reserve_array_indicies cause panics or silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [Empty Vector] If an obligation has no deposits or borrows, array_indices will be empty - does suilend_compound_interest handle an empty vector correctly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Reserve Mismatch] If reserves vector is modified between getting deposits/borrows and accessing reserves[index], could there be a race condition or stale data issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker pass mismatched PrincipalCoinType and ObligationType generics to bypass type safety and access obligations from different markets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Generic Mismatch] If the SuilendObligationOwnerCap<ObligationType> retrieved from the vault has a different ObligationType than the lending_market parameter, will this cause a type error or silent misbehavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Obligation Type Safety] Does the ObligationType generic properly enforce that the obligation_cap matches the lending_market, or can cross-market contamination occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Asset Type Spoofing] Can an attacker craft an asset_type String that collides with existing assets but points to a different obligation cap, allowing them to update wrong positions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Reentrancy] Can any of the Suilend calls (compound_interest, obligation access, market_value calculations) trigger callbacks that re-enter the vault during value update? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [State Inconsistency] If compound_interest modifies the lending_market state, could multiple concurrent calls to update_suilend_position_value on different assets create race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Read Consistency] Between reading deposits and borrows from the obligation, can the obligation state change, causing inconsistent valuation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Atomic Operations] Is the sequence of compound_interest -> parse_obligation -> finish_update_asset_value atomic, or can external state changes between steps invalidate the calculation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: update_suilend_position_value()] [Suilend Protocol Changes] If Suilend updates their protocol and changes obligation structure, reserve pricing, or compounding logic, will this adaptor fail safely or produce incorrect valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Reserve API Changes] If reserve::ctoken_market_value or reserve::market_value changes its calculation method, will the adaptor detect the discrepancy or silently use wrong values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: suilend_compound_interest()] [Compound Interest Failure] If lending_market.compound_interest fails or reverts for any reserve, does the entire transaction roll back, or can partial compounding create inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Obligation API Changes] If the Obligation type changes its deposits() or borrows() iterator behavior, could this cause the do_ref! loops to behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Maximum Deposits] If an obligation has hundreds or thousands of deposits, will the accumulation loop cause gas exhaustion or hit computational limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Maximum Borrows] Similarly, can an extremely large number of borrows cause the function to exceed gas limits during iteration? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: get_reserve_array_indicies()] [Vector Growth] If deposits and borrows together exceed vector capacity, will vector::push_back cause reallocation issues or gas spikes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/adaptors/suilend_adaptor.move] [Function: parse_suilend_obligation()] [Zero Deposits] If deposited_ctoken_amount() is zero for a deposit entry, does ctoken_market_value handle this correctly, or could there be division errors? (Low)"
