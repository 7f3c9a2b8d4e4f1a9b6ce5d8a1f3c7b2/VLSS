  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Concurrent Migration] Can multiple transactions call version_migrate() concurrently on different Storage objects, and if constants::version() changes mid-migration, will some migrations use old version while others use new version? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Read-After-Write] If transaction A reads this_version() as 13, then transaction B updates constants to version 14, then transaction A continues and writes storage.version = 13, is the Storage object now invalid? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Parallel Transactions] Can an attacker submit parallel transactions where some pass pre_check_version() with old version while others pass with new version, causing inconsistent state updates to the same Storage object? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Failed Transaction Recovery] If a transaction fails after pre_check_version() succeeds but before completion, could partial state changes remain that expect a certain version while the object version stays unchanged? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Assertion Revert] When pre_check_version() assertion fails, does the entire transaction revert cleanly, or could gas exhaustion or other issues leave the Storage object in a partially modified state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Bridge Version Sync] If lending_core is deployed on multiple Sui networks or chains, can version skew between deployments cause issues when objects are bridged cross-chain? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker replay a valid transaction from version 12 protocol against version 13 protocol, bypassing pre_check_version() through transaction malleability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Error Module Upgrade] If lending_core::error module is upgraded and error::incorrect_version() error code changes, will old transactions that expect old error codes behave differently with new error codes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Error Code Parsing] Do external systems parse the incorrect_version() error code (1400), and if this code changes between versions, will it break integrations or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Public Visibility] Since this_version() and next_version() are public, can they be called from arbitrary modules outside lending_core, potentially being misused in unintended contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Public Visibility] Since pre_check_version() is public, can malicious modules import and call it with arbitrary u64 values to test version values or cause side effects? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Flash Loan Version Window] Can an attacker take a flash loan on version 12 Config, the protocol migrates to version 13 mid-transaction, and repayment fails due to version mismatch, leaving the protocol in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Flash Loan Config Creation] When flash_loan::create_config() sets version = this_version(), if this happens during a migration window, could the Config be created with wrong version? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Oracle Price Version] If oracle.move has version checks but price feeds don't, can an attacker use outdated price feeds with new version oracle logic to manipulate prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Oracle Config Sync] Must Oracle configs be migrated before Storage objects, or can they be migrated in any order, and does wrong ordering create arbitrage opportunities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Incentive Calculation Version] Do incentive_v2 and incentive_v3 modules have independent versions, and can version skew between incentive modules and storage.move cause incorrect reward calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Incentive Retroactive] If incentives are calculated based on historical data but Storage version changes, will retroactive calculations use old or new formulas, potentially over/under-paying rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Version 13 Semantics] The current version is hardcoded as 13 in constants.move. What were versions 1-12, and could vulnerabilities from those versions resurface if migration logic is incomplete? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Version 14 Planning] If next_version() returns 14, is there actual code/migration logic for version 14, or is this function premature and could cause confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Type Parameter] Should pre_check_version() accept a generic type parameter to ensure version checks are typed to specific Storage/Config types, preventing version checks on wrong object types? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Return Type] Could this_version() return a stronger type than u64 (e.g., a phantom type Version) to prevent accidental arithmetic or comparison with non-version u64 values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Missing Documentation] Since the version module has no doc comments, could developers misunderstand when to call pre_check_version(), leading to missing checks in critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Unclear Purpose] What is the intended use of next_version(), and if it's meant for migration targets, should there be logic enforcing that objects can only migrate to next_version() and not arbitrary future versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Single Point of Failure] Since all modules depend on lending_core::version for version checks, if this module has a bug or the constants module is compromised, the entire protocol's version enforcement fails. Is there defense in depth? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Centralized Version Control] Does a single constants::version() value control all module versions, or should each module have independent versioning to allow partial upgrades? (Medium)"
