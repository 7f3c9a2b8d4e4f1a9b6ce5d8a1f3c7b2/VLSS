  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Negative Balance] If is_increase is false and estimate_value exceeds actual loan balance in dynamic_user_loan_value (line 145), can this cause underflow resulting in massive apparent debt? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Loop Manipulation] The while loop at line 137 uses len which is updated at line 132. Can race conditions or improper len updates cause the loop to skip assets or process invalid indices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Oracle Dependency] Since loan value depends on oracle prices via dynamic_user_loan_value, can stale or manipulated oracle prices allow users to borrow more than they should? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Storage Consistency] If storage::get_user_assets returns stale data at line 123, can the loan value calculation be incorrect, allowing over-borrowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_health_loan_value()] [Empty Loans Vector] If loans vector is empty initially and is_increase is false, can this cause issues in the loop logic or return incorrect 0 value enabling infinite borrowing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_collateral_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] The function relies on calculator::calculate_value at line 164 using oracle prices. Can an attacker front-run oracle updates to inflate collateral value before borrowing? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_collateral_value()] [Balance Overflow] If dynamic_user_collateral_balance returns an overflowed value at line 161, can the calculate_value multiply this by price causing further overflow and incorrect collateral valuation? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_collateral_value()] [Stale Price] If the oracle price is stale but still accepted, can users maintain unsafe positions that should be liquidated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_collateral_value()] [Zero Balance] If balance is 0, calculate_value returns 0. Can this be exploited in scenarios where collateral is temporarily moved to return 0 value during health checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_loan_value()] [Oracle Manipulation] Similar to collateral value, this function uses oracle prices at line 179.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_loan_value()] [Oracle ID Mismatch] If the oracle_id at line 177 doesn't match the asset type, can this cause valuation using wrong price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_loan_value()] [Price Precision] Can precision loss in calculate_value when converting between decimals cause loan values to be rounded down, allowing over-leveraging? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_loan_value()] [Zero Price] If oracle returns 0 price for an asset, calculate_value returns 0 loan value.

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_user_collateral_balance()] [Integer Overflow] At line 193, if is_increase is true, can supply_balance + estimate_value overflow, wrapping to a small value and causing incorrect liquidation?
