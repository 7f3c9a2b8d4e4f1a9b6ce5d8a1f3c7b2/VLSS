  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call update_single_price() during a version migration window when version_verification passes but the config is in an inconsistent state, allowing price updates with invalid configuration parameters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Pause Bypass] If the pause flag is toggled from true to false within the same transaction block, can the version_verification and pause check be bypassed through transaction ordering, allowing price updates during intended pause periods? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to update_single_price() for the same feed_address create race conditions in pause state reads, allowing one transaction to update prices while another sees paused=true? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Authorization] Does version_verification properly validate all historical version migrations, or can an attacker downgrade the config version to bypass newer security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [State Inconsistency] If a price feed is disabled after passing the enable check but before the price update at line 164, can stale prices be written to a disabled feed, violating the disable invariant? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Silent Failure] The early return at line 61 when price feed is disabled occurs without emitting any event - can this silent failure mask critical feed unavailability and cause downstream protocols to use stale prices indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [DoS] Can a malicious admin repeatedly toggle price feed enable/disable states to prevent legitimate price updates, causing all downstream protocols to operate on increasingly stale prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Empty Provider Bypass] When primary_oracle_provider is empty at line 75, the function returns without error or event - can this silent failure during oracle migration windows cause protocols to continue using dangerously stale prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Provider Config Race] If primary_oracle_provider_config is disabled between line 78's enable check and line 83's price fetch, can invalid/malicious prices be fetched from a disabled provider? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Silent Admin Action] Line 80-81 comments indicate admin should shut down the provider before reaching disabled state - if admin fails to do so, the silent return allows price staleness without any alert. Can this lead to cascading failures in dependent protocols? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Decimal Overflow] When get_price_from_adaptor converts prices to target_decimal at line 83, can extreme price values combined with decimal scaling cause u256 overflow, returning wrapped-around prices that pass subsequent validations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timestamp Manipulation] The primary_updated_time from get_price_from_adaptor could be manipulated by malicious oracle providers - is there validation that this timestamp is not in the future or unreasonably far in the past? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Stale Adaptor Data] If the oracle adaptor (Supra/Pyth) returns cached data with outdated timestamps, but get_price_from_adaptor doesn't validate recency, can stale prices bypass the freshness check at line 84? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timestamp Comparison] In strategy::is_oracle_price_fresh, if current_timestamp < oracle_timestamp due to clock manipulation or oracle future-dating, the function returns false - but can this be exploited to force fallback to secondary oracle even when primary is valid? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Max Diff Exploit] If max_timestamp_diff is set to an extremely large value (e.g., u64::MAX), can arbitrarily stale prices be accepted as fresh, allowing price manipulation through old oracle data? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Clock Dependency] The freshness check depends on clock::timestamp_ms - if the Sui clock can be influenced or if there are clock skew issues across validators, can this cause inconsistent freshness determinations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Secondary Availability Race] Between checking is_secondary_oracle_available at line 88 and fetching price at line 93, if secondary provider is disabled, can invalid prices be fetched? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Double Fetch Risk] Both primary (line 83) and secondary (line 93) call get_price_from_adaptor with the same oracle holders - can reentrancy or state changes between these calls cause price inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Decimal Mismatch] If primary and secondary providers use different decimal bases internally, but both convert to target_decimal, can precision loss differences cause false price deviation alerts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Bypass] When both prices are fresh but severity at line 104 is level_warning, the function continues with start_or_continue_diff_threshold2_timer=true - can an attacker maintain prices just above threshold1 but below threshold2 indefinitely to avoid critical alerts while manipulating price spreads? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timer Manipulation] If validate_price_difference at line 104 reads diff_threshold2_timer but another transaction updates it concurrently, can the severity calculation be incorrect, allowing critical price deviations to be classified as warnings? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Level Critical Return] When severity is level_critical at line 118, the function returns without updating prices - but can this cause indefinite price staleness if both oracles persistently diverge, creating DoS for all dependent protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Event Emission Only] The PriceRegulation event at line 106 is emitted but no on-chain state prevents subsequent operations - can protocols continue using stale prices despite critical divergence being detected and logged? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Zero Config] If price_diff_threshold1 or price_diff_threshold2 is set to 0, can validate_price_difference produce unexpected severity levels, bypassing intended price deviation controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timer Overflow] If diff_threshold2_timer is set and max_duration_within_thresholds is very large, can the addition at strategy.move line 15 (current_timestamp > max_duration_within_thresholds + ratio2_usage_start_time) overflow and incorrectly return level_warning instead of level_major? (Medium)"
