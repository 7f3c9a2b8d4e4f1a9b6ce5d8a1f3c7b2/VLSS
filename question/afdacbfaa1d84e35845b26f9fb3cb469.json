  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: unwrap_unstake_ticket()] [Missing Validation Event] Since unlock_epoch isn't validated before burn, should TicketBurnedEvent at line 147 include is_unlocked status for off-chain monitoring? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: wrap_unstake_ticket()] [Event Spam] Can attacker create thousands of zero-value tickets to spam TicketMintedEvent at line 122, causing off-chain indexer DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: unwrap_unstake_ticket()] [Epoch Mismatch] Does TicketBurnedEvent emit current epoch at line 150 instead of unlock_epoch, making it unclear if ticket was properly unlocked? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: transfer()] [Unrestricted Transfer] Since transfer at line 163 has no restrictions, can tickets be transferred to zero address or invalid addresses causing fund loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: transfer()] [Frontrunning] Can malicious actor monitor mempool for unwrap_unstake_ticket transactions and transfer ticket away before burn, griefing legitimate redemptions? (Medium)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: transfer()] [Package Visibility] Since transfer is public(package) at line 163, can malicious package modules force-transfer tickets to attacker addresses? (High)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Struct: UnstakeTicket] [Missing Store] Why doesn't UnstakeTicket have 'store' ability at line 33? Does this prevent tickets from being stored in collections or wrapped in other objects? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Struct: UnstakeTicket] [Key Only] With only 'key' ability, can UnstakeTicket objects be lost if there's no proper transfer mechanism after creation? (Medium)",

  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Struct: Metadata] [Table Lifetime] Does max_history_value Table at line 45 get properly destroyed when Metadata is deleted, or can it leak storage? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Version Check] Is VERSION constant at line 12 validated anywhere? Can mismatched versions between Metadata and code logic cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Function: create_metadata()] [Version Init] Is version initialized to VERSION at line 53 checked during operations to prevent version mismatch attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/unstake_ticket.move] [Migration] Can Metadata objects with old version values be migrated to VERSION=2, or will they remain stuck with incompatible state? (Medium)",
