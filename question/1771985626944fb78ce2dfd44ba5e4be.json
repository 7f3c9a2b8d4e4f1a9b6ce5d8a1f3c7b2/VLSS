  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor accepts arbitrary request_id without validation - can an attacker manipulate request ordering or create duplicate IDs if called directly from package code, potentially causing request_id collision in the withdraw_requests table? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor accepts zero or maximum u256 shares without bounds checking - can this lead to share accounting overflow when executing withdrawals, or allow users to request withdrawal of more shares than exist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor accepts arbitrary expected_amount (u64) without correlation to shares (u256) - can users set expected_amount=0 to bypass slippage protection in execute_withdraw, receiving less than they should? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor allows receipt_id = address::from_u256(0) - can this create confusion with the special zero-address recipient logic used for manual claim vs auto-transfer, potentially routing funds incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor accepts vault_id without validating it matches the actual vault being used - can cross-vault withdrawal requests be created, breaking the invariant that requests belong to specific vaults? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The constructor accepts timestamp parameter directly - if clock.timestamp_ms() is not used consistently, can past or future timestamps be injected to bypass locking_time_for_cancel_request checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Validation] The recipient parameter accepts any address including zero - if recipient validation is not enforced elsewhere, can funds be sent to burn addresses or invalid recipients? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Type Mismatch] The shares field is u256 but expected_amount is u64 - when shares_to_withdraw * ratio produces USD value, can this overflow u64 bounds during price conversion in execute_withdraw, causing reverts or incorrect withdrawal amounts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Type Limitation] The expected_amount field is u64 (max ~18.4 * 10^18) - for high-value principal tokens with low decimals, can legitimate withdrawal amounts exceed u64::MAX, making large withdrawals impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Type Limitation] The request_time field is u64 timestamp_ms - when adding locking_time_for_cancel_request in cancel_withdraw, can this overflow if locking_time is set to near u64::MAX, permanently locking cancellation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: shares()] [Type Conversion Risk] Getter returns u256 shares directly - when this is used in math operations with u64 amounts in execute_withdraw, can mixed-precision arithmetic cause truncation or unexpected wrapping? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Ability: copy] The struct has 'copy' ability - can requests be duplicated in package code, allowing the same request to be executed multiple times if proper deletion isn't enforced? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Ability: drop] The struct has 'drop' ability - can requests be silently dropped without proper cleanup of receipt pending_withdraw_shares, leaving receipts in inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Ability: store] The struct has 'store' ability allowing table storage - can requests be stored in unauthorized locations outside request_buffer, bypassing request lifecycle controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Missing State Field] The struct lacks a 'cancelled' or 'executed' status field - can cancelled or executed requests be re-processed if not deleted from the table, allowing double-withdrawal? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Missing Field] No expiration_time field exists - can requests remain in the buffer indefinitely, allowing execution at arbitrary future share ratios that may be manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Missing Field] No max_slippage_bps field - users must rely solely on expected_amount for slippage protection, but can operators exploit this by timing execution when share_ratio is exactly at expected_amount, still giving users worst-case outcomes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Missing Validation Field] No signature or authorization proof - requests stored in table rely on prior checks, but can package functions create requests bypassing user authorization? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Missing Return Validation] The constructor returns WithdrawRequest directly without checking invariants - can malformed requests with shares=0 or mismatched IDs be created and stored? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Functions: request_id(), receipt_id(), vault_id()] [Public Visibility] All getters are public - can external contracts read sensitive request details and front-run withdraw executions by monitoring request_time and expected_amount? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: recipient()] [Address Exposure] Public getter exposes recipient address - can this leak privacy about which addresses are withdrawing, enabling MEV attacks or targeted DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: expected_amount()] [Slippage Exposure] Public getter exposes expected_amount - can operators or arbitrageurs monitor this to execute withdrawals only when market conditions give them maximal benefit at user expense? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Cross-Module Risk] The struct is package-visible only through 'new()' but stored in public table - if table access isn't properly gated in volo_vault.move, can unauthorized actors read/write requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Function: new()] [Package Visibility] Constructor is package-visible - can other package modules create requests without going through request_withdraw(), bypassing receipt ownership and share balance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Struct: WithdrawRequest] [Receipt Binding] Only receipt_id is stored, not receipt object reference - can requests persist after receipts are destroyed, creating dangling requests that reference non-existent receipts? (Medium)"
