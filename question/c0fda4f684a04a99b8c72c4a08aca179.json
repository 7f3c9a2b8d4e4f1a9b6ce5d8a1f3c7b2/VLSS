  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] If queue.has_authority(ctx) check can be bypassed through a compromised Queue module or malicious fork, could an attacker override oracle credentials with their own TEE keys, manipulating all price feeds and causing vault liquidations or incorrect valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Access Control] Can an attacker front-run legitimate queue authority changes to call run() with malicious secp256k1_key and mr_enclave before proper authority is revoked, permanently corrupting oracle attestation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authorization Timing] If has_authority check passes in validate() but authority is revoked before actuate() executes (multi-sig delay, consensus lag), could the oracle override still complete, violating authorization invariants? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Multi-Party Auth] Does has_authority support multi-sig requirements? If single authority can override oracles, could a compromised key enable complete price feed takeover affecting all vaults? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Escalation] Can an attacker exploit validator pool delegation or operator caps in the broader Volo system to gain queue authority indirectly, bypassing intended access controls for oracle overrides? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Mismatch] If EXPECTED_ORACLE_VERSION or EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION are hardcoded to 1, but upgraded oracle/queue contracts use version 2+, would legitimate override operations fail, causing DoS on critical price feed updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade] If an attacker can deploy or reference legacy Oracle v1 contracts when the system expects v2+, could they bypass security improvements and exploit old vulnerabilities through version validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Immutability] Since version checks are equality-based, not range-based, does protocol upgrade require redeploying this action module? Could version lock-in delay critical security patches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Race] If queue.version() or oracle.version() can be updated mid-transaction through reentrancy, could TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) allow version validation bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Key Mismatch] If queue.queue_key() != oracle.queue_key() check can be satisfied with colliding keys (hash collision, weak key generation), could attacker bind oracle to wrong queue, mixing price feeds across unrelated protocols? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue ID Spoofing] If queue.id() == oracle.queue() can be satisfied through ID manipulation or object wrapping, could attacker override oracles belonging to different queues, causing cross-vault price corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Orphaned Oracle] If an oracle's queue reference becomes stale (queue deleted, ID reused), but validation passes due to ID collision, could override operation corrupt unrelated queue's oracle state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue-Oracle Desync] Between queue_key and queue_id checks, if either queue or oracle state mutates through reentrancy, could TOCTOU enable binding oracle to mismatched queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Multiple Queue Binding] Can a single oracle be bound to multiple queues by satisfying validation with different queue objects in separate transactions, enabling one oracle to serve conflicting price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Expiration Time Underflow] Validation only checks expiration_time_ms > 0, but if clock.timestamp_ms() can overflow or expiration_time_ms can be set to u64::MAX, could oracle credentials never expire, violating TEE key rotation security requirements? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Expiration Too Short] If expiration_time_ms = 1ms is technically valid (>0), could attacker set ultra-short expiration causing immediate oracle invalidation and vault operation DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Upper Bound] Since only lower bound (>0) is checked, could expiration_time_ms be set centuries into future, permanently locking in potentially compromised TEE credentials? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Expiration vs Clock] Validation doesn't compare expiration_time_ms against current clock.timestamp_ms(). Could attacker set expiration in the past, creating immediately-expired oracle that passes validation but fails in use? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Expiration Semantics] Is expiration_time_ms an absolute timestamp or duration?

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: run()] [Key Reuse] No check prevents reusing same secp256k1_key across multiple oracles. Could key compromise affect multiple oracles simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_override_oracle_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Enclave Revocation] If mr_enclave is later found vulnerable or compromised, no revocation mechanism exists. Could stale enclave measurements remain active indefinitely? (High)",
