  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_base_rate()] [Rate Manipulation] Can base_rate be set to near u256::max() causing current_borrow_rate calculations to overflow and break interest accrual for all borrowers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_multiplier()] [Exponential Rate Attack] Can multiplier be set to extreme value causing borrow rate to spike during high utilization, forcing emergency repayments or liquidations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_jump_rate_multiplier()] [Jump Rate Grief] Can jump_rate_multiplier change from 0 to massive value when utilization crosses optimal_utilization, causing sudden 100x rate increase that liquidates all borrowers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_reserve_factor()] [Protocol Insolvency] Can reserve_factor be set to 0%, eliminating protocol's share of interest, making protocol unable to cover bad debt or operational costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_optimal_utilization()] [Utilization Jump] Can optimal_utilization be changed from 90% to 10% when utilization is 50%, instantly triggering jump rate multiplier and exploding borrow costs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_ratio()] [Liquidation Profit Manipulation] Can liquidation_ratio be increased to give liquidators excessive profit margins, incentivizing aggressive liquidation of healthy positions for maximum extraction?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_bonus()] [Bonus Stacking] Can liquidation_bonus changes stack with liquidation_ratio to exceed 100% total liquidator profit, allowing liquidators to drain more than collateral value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_liquidation_threshold()] [Threshold Inversion] Can liquidation_threshold be set below ltv value, creating logical impossibility where loans are liquidatable before they can be created? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 249-254] [No Event Emission] Do parameter update functions fail to emit events, preventing off-chain monitoring systems from detecting malicious parameter changes in real-time? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Lines: 242-339] [Atomic Update Failure] Can parameter updates fail to be atomic with corresponding Pool or oracle updates, creating inconsistent state where storage parameter mismatches external dependencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: set_supply_cap()] [Zero Cap Attack] Can supply_cap_ceiling be set to 0 to permanently freeze deposits, then OwnerCap holder can force-liquidate all borrowers due to no new supply entering system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_balance()] [Table Double-Add] Can increase_balance() fail to properly handle case where user already exists in user_state, causing table::add() to abort after table::remove(), losing user's previous balance? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_balance()] [Overflow Unchecked] Does current_amount + amount overflow check exist, or can u256 overflow wrap to small value, crediting attacker with near-zero balance instead of massive amount? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_balance()] [Total Supply Mismatch] Can total_supply += amount overflow independently from user balance, causing total to be less than sum of all user balances and breaking accounting invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: decrease_balance()] [Underflow Attack] Can decrease_balance() be called with amount=0 to probe user balance existence, then repeatedly called with exact balance to race against other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: decrease_balance()] [Insufficient Balance Check] Does assert!(current_amount >= amount) at line 559 execute before table::add(), and can table operation fail after assert passes, leaving total_supply decremented but user balance unchanged? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: decrease_balance()] [Zero Balance Handling] Can decreasing balance to exactly zero leave entry in user_state table, wasting storage and potentially causing issues if balance operations assume non-existence means zero? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_balance_for_pool()] [Independent Supply/Borrow] Can in_supply and in_borrow be manipulated independently to create imbalance where total_supply exceeds reasonable bounds relative to actual Pool reserves? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_supply_balance()] [Cross-User Attack] Can increase_supply_balance() be called for user A while simultaneously decrease_supply_balance() for user B to transfer balance off-chain without proper authorization checks?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: decrease_supply_balance()] [Total Supply Underflow] Can total_supply underflow if decrease_supply_balance() is called with amount > total_supply due to racing updates from multiple friend modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: increase_borrow_balance()] [Borrow Cap Bypass] Does increase_borrow_balance() check borrow_cap_ceiling before increasing, or can it allow total borrow to exceed cap through friend function path? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/storage.move] [Function: decrease_borrow_balance()] [Negative Borrow] Can decrease_borrow_balance() reduce total_supply below zero if called with invalid amount, wrapping u256 to create massive false borrow balance? (Critical)",
