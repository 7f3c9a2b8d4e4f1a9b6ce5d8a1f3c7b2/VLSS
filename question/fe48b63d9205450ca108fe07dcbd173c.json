  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Insufficient Balance Check] Does the assertion check for >= instead of >, meaning deposit_amount can equal total_supply and drain the pool completely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Insufficient Balance Check] Similarly, does using >= instead of > allow draining the entire treasury_balance, violating minimum reserve requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Insufficient Balance Check] Can the >= assertion allow withdrawing all reserves, breaking protocols that depend on minimum liquidity thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Balance Join Safety] Does balance::join() have overflow protection, or can joining a large mint_balance with an already large pool.balance cause silent overflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Balance Join Safety] Can balance::join(&mut pool.treasury_balance, decrease_balance) overflow treasury_balance if decrease_balance is extremely large? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Balance Split Safety] Does balance::split() handle edge cases correctly when amount equals pool.balance, leaving an empty Balance<CoinType>? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [Balance Split Safety] Can balance::split(&mut pool.balance, amount) cause issues if called with amount = 0 despite the early return check? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: Pool] [Balance Type Confusion] Can Pool<CoinTypeA> and Pool<CoinTypeB> balances be mixed through type parameter manipulation in friend modules? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Coin Destruction] After coin::into_balance(), is the original Coin<CoinType> properly destroyed, or can it be referenced again causing double-counting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Coin Creation] Does coin::from_balance() properly transfer ownership, or can the Balance<CoinType> still be accessed after coin creation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Operation Ordering] Can the balance::split() and balance::join() operations be reordered or interleaved with other transactions, breaking atomicity? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Operation Ordering] Similarly, can concurrent withdraw_treasury() calls from different transactions cause race conditions in balance::split() operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Event-Balance Mismatch] Can the emitted PoolDeposit event show a different amount than actually joined to pool.balance due to timing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Event-Balance Mismatch] Can the emitted PoolWithdraw event show a different amount than actually split from pool.balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_balance()] [User Tracking] Since the user parameter is arbitrary, can friend modules attribute deposits to wrong users, breaking balance tracking in dependent systems? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_balance()] [User Tracking] Can withdraw_balance() emit events with sender == recipient == user, hiding the actual transaction sender and breaking audit trails? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit_treasury()] [Missing Event] Why doesn't deposit_treasury() emit an event, making it impossible to track fund movements from balance to treasury_balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_treasury()] [Event Incompleteness] Does the withdraw_treasury() function emit an event? If not, can treasury withdrawals go undetected in off-chain monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: withdraw_reserve_balance()] [Event Structure] The PoolWithdrawReserve event includes before/after/poolId - can these fields be manipulated or calculated incorrectly due to concurrent state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Struct: Pool] [Balance Initialization] Are pool.balance and pool.treasury_balance initialized to zero in create_pool(), or can they start with non-zero values through struct manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: create_pool()] [Balance Zero Check] Does balance::zero<CoinType>() guarantee a true zero balance, or can it be overridden in custom CoinType implementations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/pool.move] [Function: deposit()] [Balance Finality] After balance::join(), is the balance change immediately visible to concurrent transactions, or is there a commit delay? (Medium)",
