  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Constant: MAX_STALENESS_SECONDS] [Configuration Risk] Is 60 seconds appropriate for all asset types, or should high-volatility assets have stricter staleness requirements to prevent using outdated prices during rapid price movements? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Time Synchronization] The code assumes Clock and Pyth timestamps are synchronized, but what if they drift apart due to different time sources? Could this cause persistent false positives/negatives in staleness checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Rounding Error] Do the mul() and div() operations at lines 60-68 use consistent rounding modes (round down, round up, round nearest), and could rounding direction be exploited for price manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Denominator Edge Case] If the calculated denominator (10^expo) becomes 1, does the division optimize correctly, or could there be unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Numerator Edge Case] If price_mag is 1 and expo is large positive, could the multiplication create a price that exceeds the Decimal type's maximum representable value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Validation Order] The confidence check (line 36) occurs before the staleness check (line 43) - could an attacker bypass one by failing the other intentionally, and does order matter? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Early Return] Both validation failures return early with option::none() - could this create different gas costs that leak information about which validation failed? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Missing Validation] Are there any other Pyth price fields that should be validated (e.g., price status, number of publishers) but are currently unchecked? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Asset Verification] The price_identifier is returned but not validated against an expected value - could callers accidentally use a price feed for the wrong asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Identifier Mutation] Is the price_identifier immutable after extraction, or could it be modified before being used by the caller? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Staleness] The EMA price retrieved at line 27 doesn't undergo staleness checks - could an attacker use a very old EMA price if spot prices have been stale for extended periods? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Confidence] Does the EMA price have its own confidence interval that should be checked, or is it assumed to be more stable than spot? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [EMA Manipulation] Could attackers manipulate the EMA price by submitting a series of manipulated spot prices that gradually shift the EMA in their favor? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [EMA Parsing] When parsing EMA price at line 27, if the EMA has a negative value (should be impossible but hypothetically), does it abort consistently? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Vault Valuation] When Volo vault uses this oracle for USD valuations, if spot price returns None but EMA is available, could vault operations use stale EMA causing incorrect asset valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Health Factor Calculation] If the health limiter uses prices from this oracle, could failing confidence/staleness checks cause health factor calculations to fail, blocking legitimate vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Loss Tolerance] Could an attacker exploit the 60-second staleness window to execute operations at stale prices during rapid market movements, exceeding the vault's loss tolerance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Operation Lifecycle] If vault operations start with valid prices but prices become stale mid-operation (>60s execution time), could operations complete with inconsistent pricing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Module: oracles] [Adaptor Integration] When Suilend adaptor borrows/returns assets valued by this oracle, could stale prices cause incorrect borrow amounts or health checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: get_pyth_price_and_identifier()] [Confidence Manipulation] If an attacker can influence the Pyth confidence value (e.g., through flash loan manipulation of underlying markets), can they trigger price rejection at will? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Exponential Manipulation] If an attacker controls the price feed and sets expo to extreme values (e.g., 100 or -100), could this cause the pow() operations to fail or produce unrepresentable decimals? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Function: parse_price_to_decimal()] [Magnitude Extraction] Could the get_magnitude_if_positive functions fail to extract magnitude correctly for edge case i64 values near overflow boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Constants: MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO, MAX_STALENESS_SECONDS] [Immutability Risk] Since these constants cannot be updated without module upgrade, could market conditions or network changes make these values obsolete, permanently breaking oracle functionality? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Constant: MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO] [Denial of Service] Could an attacker monitor Pyth confidence intervals and front-run vault operations during periods when confidence naturally exceeds 10%, causing transaction failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/oracles.move] [Constant: MAX_STALENESS_SECONDS] [Network Delay] During Sui network congestion where block times exceed 1 second, could the 60-second staleness window be insufficient, causing legitimate fresh prices to appear stale? (Medium)"
