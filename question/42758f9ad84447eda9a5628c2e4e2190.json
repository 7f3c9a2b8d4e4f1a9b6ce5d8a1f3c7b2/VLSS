  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Race Condition] Can admin transaction sequence race with user operations to frontrun/backrun user actions (e.g., set_deposit_fee before execute_deposit)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [State Consistency] If multiple admin setters are called in same PTB (set_deposit_fee + set_withdraw_fee + set_loss_tolerance), can this cause state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Oracle Manipulation] Can admin call add_switchboard_aggregator + change_switchboard_aggregator + set_update_interval in sequence to manipulate price acceptance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Operator Management] Can create_operator_cap + set_operator_freezed(false) sequence be exploited to quickly create and authorize malicious operators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Fee Extraction] Can set_deposit_fee(max) + set_withdraw_fee(max) + retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee be chained to extract maximum fees immediately? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Upgrade Attack] Can upgrade_vault + upgrade_reward_manager + upgrade_oracle_config in wrong order cause version desync between components? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Cross-Function] [Lock Manipulation] Can set_locking_time_for_withdraw(0) + set_locking_time_for_cancel_request(0) enable flash loan attacks by removing all timing restrictions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Integration] [Version Check] Do all admin functions properly call vault.check_version() or can stale vault versions be operated on? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Integration] [Status Gating] Do setter functions verify vault status (not during operation) before modifying critical parameters? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Integration] [Event Consistency] Are events emitted in manage.move consistent with events in vault.move for same state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Integration] [Error Handling] Do manage.move functions properly propagate errors from vault.move or can error masking occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Integration] [Parameter Bounds] Do manage.move functions validate parameters against same constants as vault.move (MAX_DEPOSIT_FEE_RATE, RATE_SCALING, etc.)? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Access Control] [AdminCap Transfer] Can AdminCap be transferred to attacker address, compromising entire vault governance? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Access Control] [OperatorCap Theft] Can OperatorCap created by create_operator_cap be stolen or transferred without admin knowledge? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Access Control] [Capability Validation] Do functions validate AdminCap/OperatorCap are for correct deployment or can cross-deployment caps work? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Access Control] [Role Separation] Is there proper separation between admin (governance) and operator (execution) roles, or can operator escalate to admin? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Oracle] [Price Feed Manipulation] Can admin swap oracle aggregators to manipulate prices for share ratio calculation in deposits/withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Oracle] [Staleness Window] Can set_update_interval be used to accept prices older than epoch duration, enabling price oracle attacks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Oracle] [Decimal Precision Loss] Can incorrect decimals in add_switchboard_aggregator cause rounding errors in USD value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Oracle] [Asset Type String] Can oracle functions be exploited with malformed asset_type strings to cause lookup failures or injections? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Oracle] [Aggregator Replacement] Does change_switchboard_aggregator properly validate new aggregator has same characteristics as old one? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Fees] [Dynamic Fee Attack] Can admin dynamically adjust fees between user request and execution to extract unexpected fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Fees] [Fee Cap Bypass] Are MAX_DEPOSIT_FEE_RATE and MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_RATE enforced in manage.move or only in vault.move? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Fees] [Zero Fee Risk] Can deposit/withdraw fees be set to 0, breaking protocol economics and revenue model? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Fees] [Fee Collection Drain] Can admin/operator drain fee_collected balance faster than fees accumulate? (Medium)"
