  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Atomicity Guarantee] Three separate operations: validate(), actuate(), queue::new(). If system crashes between steps, can this leave partial state? Does Move's transaction semantics guarantee full rollback? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Queue Reference Check-Time-Of-Use] Takes &Queue reference but doesn't hold lock. Can another transaction modify guardian_queue between version() check and id() extraction causing race condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [queue_key as Identifier] If queue_key is used as cryptographic identifier or hash input, lack of validation means attacker can choose colliding keys to exploit hash-based lookups in downstream code. (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Guardian Queue ID Integrity] guardian_queue_id from guardian_queue.id() is passed to queue::new() and emitted. If Queue.id() method is compromised to return attacker-controlled ID, can this link queues to wrong guardians? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue ID Predictability] If queue::new() generates deterministic IDs based on inputs, can attacker pre-compute queue IDs to front-run or create collision attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Address Validity] authority parameter is address type but not validated. Can attacker use uninitialized or invalid address causing issues when queue module tries to grant permissions to non-existent account? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Consensus Threshold Bypass] Only validates min_attestations > 0. If Volo Vault expects minimum safety threshold (e.g., >=3), can attacker create queue with min_attestations=1 providing single-source oracle data vulnerable to manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validity Window Too Short] No minimum oracle_validity_length_ms enforced. Can setting 1ms force vault operations to always fail due to expired prices, DoSing deposits/withdrawals/operations in Volo Vault? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Validity Window Too Long] No maximum oracle_validity_length_ms enforced. Can setting u64::MAX allow months-old price data to be considered fresh, enabling attacker to wait for favorable old prices then execute vault operations at stale rates? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Authority Control] authority parameter determines who controls oracle. Can attacker set this to their address then manipulate oracle responses after Volo Vault trusts the queue, causing price manipulation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Manipulation to Control Selection] If Volo Vault selects cheapest oracle, can attacker create low-fee malicious queue, get selected, then manipulate prices? Is there quality/reputation weighting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Queue Compromise] If guardian_queue reference points to attacker-controlled queue that passes version check, can attacker inherit guardian privileges to all child queues, compromising Volo Vault oracle integrity? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Proliferation Attack] No limit on queues per guardian. Can attacker create thousands of queues under same guardian to dilute trust/reputation metrics or overwhelm queue selection logic in Volo Vault? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Name Squatting] No uniqueness requirement for name parameter. Can attacker create queue with name mimicking official Volo oracle (e.g., 'Volo Official Price Feed') to social engineer users into trusting malicious oracle? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Fee Recipient as Attacker] Setting fee_recipient to attacker's address means attacker profits from oracle usage. Can this incentivize creation of many low-quality oracles to farm fees without providing reliable data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_check_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Delegation Risk] Creating queue with authority set to another user's address without their consent could enable sophisticated attacks where attacker frames innocent party as running malicious oracle. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Economic Stake] Queue creation requires no economic commitment. Can attacker create unlimited throwaway queues to test exploits against Volo Vault without financial risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue ID Prediction] If queue IDs are deterministic/sequential, can attacker observe pending queue creation, predict ID, and front-run to register that ID for malicious queue in Volo Vault's configuration? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Front-Running] Attacker sees pending legitimate queue creation in mempool, copies parameters but changes fee_recipient to themselves, front-runs with higher gas to steal fee revenue. (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Ordering Exploits] If indexers process events sequentially, can attacker create multiple queues in same block to manipulate which gets registered first in Volo Vault's oracle list? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Guardian Queue Sniping] Attacker monitors for new guardian queues, immediately creates child queues to claim 'first mover' advantage or exhaust queue slots if guardian has capacity limits. (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validation DoS] If guardian_queue.version() call is expensive, can attacker spam run() calls to DoS guardian queue via excessive version() queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Assert Abuse] Three asserts can fail causing transaction revert. Can attacker intentionally trigger failures to waste validator resources or create blockchain bloat with failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: run()] [queue::new() DoS] If queue module has state that can be filled/exhausted, can repeated queue::new() calls DoS the queue system preventing legitimate queue creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/oracle_queue_init_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Spam] Each queue creation emits event. Can attacker create queues rapidly to spam event logs causing indexer crashes or delays that make Volo Vault unable to detect oracle issues in real-time? (Medium)"
