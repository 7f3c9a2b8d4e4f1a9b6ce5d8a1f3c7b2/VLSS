  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Struct: PoolInfo] [Last Update Time Initialization] last_update_time is initialized to 0 - can this cause first update to calculate rewards from Unix epoch (timestamp 0) to start_time? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Transfer to Zero Address] If account parameter is @0x0, public_transfer at line 296 sends coins to zero address - can this cause permanent fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: earned()] [Calculation Without State Update] earned() calculates rewards without calling update_reward first - can displayed earned amount differ from actual claimable amount? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: add_pool()] [Missing Asset Validation] asset parameter is u8 (0-255) but not validated against supported asset types - can invalid asset IDs cause downstream failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: base_claim_reward()] [Index Array Mismatch] current_idx from IncentiveBal is used without checking if it's within bounds of pool vectors - can corrupted current_idx cause vector index panic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: calc_pool_update_rewards()] [Supply Balance Precision] supply_balance is u256 but represents token amount - if token has 0 decimals and balance is huge, can multiplications at line 274 overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/incentive.move] [Function: update_reward()] [Conditional Table Contains] Line 191: if (table::contains(&incentive.pools, asset)) - but if pool doesn't exist, function silently returns - can this hide errors where update is expected but doesn't happen? (Low)"
