  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the has_authority() check by manipulating TxContext or spoofing the sender to remove critical fee types from the queue, potentially disrupting oracle fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authorization Weakness] Does the queue.has_authority(ctx) check properly validate against admin/operator roles, or could a malicious party with partial privileges escalate to remove fee types they shouldn't control? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Missing Authorization Re-check] After validate() passes, could the queue state or authority change before actuate() executes, allowing unauthorized fee type removal through time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Revocation Bypass] If authority is revoked mid-transaction or in a prior transaction that hasn't been committed, can the stale authority check still allow fee type removal? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Check Hardcoding] The hardcoded EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION = 1 means upgraded queues (v2+) cannot remove fee types; could this create a DoS where fee types become permanently locked in upgraded queues? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION] [Upgrade Path Vulnerability] If Queue upgrades to version 2+, this action module becomes unusable; is there a safe migration path to remove fee types from legacy queues, or will funds be locked? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Version Downgrade Attack] Could an attacker downgrade queue.version() through a separate vulnerability to bypass the version check and remove fee types maliciously? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Type Parameter Confusion] Can an attacker call run<T>() with a malicious or incorrect type parameter T that doesn't match the intended fee coin type, causing wrong fee type removal and breaking oracle economics? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Mismatch] The event emits type_name::get<Coin<T>>() but queue.remove_fee_type<T>() might use T directly; could this type wrapping mismatch cause event/state desynchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Generic Type Exploit] Can run<T>() be called with non-coin types (e.g., arbitrary structs) to corrupt the queue's fee type registry or cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Type Parameter Phantom] If T is a phantom type parameter in Queue's fee storage, could remove_fee_type<T>() succeed even when T was never registered, creating ghost event emissions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Double Removal] Can queue.remove_fee_type<T>() be called twice for the same type T without reverting, potentially emitting duplicate QueueFeeTypeRemoved events and confusing off-chain indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Non-existent Type Removal] What happens if remove_fee_type<T>() is called for a type T that was never added as a fee type? Does it revert, or silently succeed creating false event signals? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: run()] [Queue Corruption] Could removing a fee type while active oracle operations depend on it cause the queue to enter an inconsistent state, breaking ongoing price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Critical Fee Type Removal] Can an authorized party remove the primary or only fee coin type, effectively disabling all oracle fee collection and bricking the queue's economic model? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Front-running] The QueueFeeTypeRemoved event is emitted after state change; could an attacker observe the state change before event emission and exploit the gap? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Struct: QueueFeeTypeRemoved] [Event Replay Attack] Could an attacker replay or forge QueueFeeTypeRemoved events to confuse off-chain systems about which fee types are actually active? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Missing Event Data] The event only includes queue_id and fee_type but not the remover's address or timestamp; could this lack of audit trail enable undetectable malicious removals? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Emission Failure] If event::emit() fails or is suppressed, could the queue state change succeed while off-chain systems remain unaware of the fee type removal? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Module Coupling] The function depends on queue.remove_fee_type<T>() from the Queue module; if that function has vulnerabilities (e.g., no existence check), does this action inherit them? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Method Dependency] queue.has_authority() and queue.version() methods are assumed to be secure; if they have bugs (e.g., authority bypass), does this action become exploitable?
