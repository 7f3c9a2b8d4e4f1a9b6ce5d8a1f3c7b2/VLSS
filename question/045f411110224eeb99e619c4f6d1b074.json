  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_deposit()] [Type Confusion] Can an attacker pass a CoinType generic that matches storage coin_type string but represents a different asset, bypassing the type check at line 16 and depositing wrong collateral? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_deposit()] [Type String Manipulation] If storage::get_coin_type() returns a manipulated or incorrectly formatted string, can the type_name comparison at line 16 be bypassed to deposit unauthorized coin types?

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_deposit()] [Zero Amount Bypass] If amount is set to 0, the check at line 17 catches it, but can an attacker use u256::MAX or extremely small values (1 wei) to manipulate accounting while passing validation? (Medium)",
