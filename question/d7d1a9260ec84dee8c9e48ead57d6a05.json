  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Oracle Manipulation] Can admin add malicious Switchboard aggregator with incorrect decimals or stale prices to manipulate vault USD value calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Decimal Confusion] Can add_switchboard_aggregator be exploited with wrong decimals parameter (e.g., decimals=6 instead of 9) causing 1000x price inflation/deflation? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Timing Attack] Can admin add aggregator during active operation to change price source mid-operation, causing total_usd_value calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [DoS] Can add_switchboard_aggregator be called with invalid aggregator reference that always fails on price reads, DoSing all operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: add_switchboard_aggregator()] [Staleness Bypass] Does add_switchboard_aggregator initialize assets_value_updated timestamp correctly or can stale prices be accepted immediately after adding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Asset Orphaning] Can remove_switchboard_aggregator be called for asset_type that vault actively holds, causing inability to price that asset in total_usd_value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [DoS Attack] Can admin remove oracle for principal coin type, making all deposit/withdraw executions fail due to missing price feed? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [Timing Exploit] Can remove_switchboard_aggregator be called during operation while asset of that type is borrowed, causing value update failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: remove_switchboard_aggregator()] [State Corruption] Does remove_switchboard_aggregator clean up assets_value and assets_value_updated entries, or leave stale data in tables? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Price Manipulation] Can admin change aggregator to malicious one with manipulated prices to inflate/deflate vault valuation for profit? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Decimal Mismatch] Does change_switchboard_aggregator preserve decimals setting from previous aggregator or can decimal precision change, causing price calculation errors? (Critical)",

  "[File: volo-vault/sources/manage.move] [Function: change_switchboard_aggregator()] [Mid-Operation Change] Can aggregator be changed while vault is VAULT_DURING_OPERATION_STATUS, causing different price sources for start_op vs end_op value checks? (High)",
