  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Commented Code: current_minor_version] The commented code calls current_minor_version() which is not defined. If these constants are expected to be imported, could missing imports explain why the module is non-functional? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Commented Code: Version Initialization] The commented init_ shows Version initialized with current_major_version() and current_minor_version(). If these are supposed to be module constants, could their absence prevent proper version tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Commented Code: Cap Transfer] The commented code transfers VersionCap to tx_context::sender(). If implemented, could this create a single point of failure where losing the sender's keys loses all version control? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Commented Code: Share Object] The commented code shows transfer::share_object(version) commented out. If Version is not shared, how can multiple modules access it for version checking? Could this indicate architectural problems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Abort Code: Uniformity] All functions abort with code 0, providing no diagnostic information. Could this make it impossible to distinguish which function failed, complicating debugging of version-related issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Abort Code: Error Constants] No error constants are defined (ENotAuthorized, EInvalidVersion, etc.). If this module were implemented, could missing error codes lead to unclear failure messages? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Abort Code: Zero Semantics] Abort code 0 typically means success or uninitialized error. Could using 0 for intentional aborts cause confusion with unintended errors elsewhere in the codebase? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Dependency: Local Copy] This is in local_dependencies/mmt_v3, suggesting it's a local copy of an external package. If the upstream MMT v3 package has a functional version.move, could deployment confusion cause Volo to use this broken stub instead? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Dependency: Module Resolution] If multiple version modules exist (local stub vs. actual MMT v3 package), could Move's module resolution rules cause the wrong version to be imported, breaking version checks system-wide? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Dependency: Package Publish] If this stub is published to mainnet, could it prevent the real MMT v3 package from being published at the same address due to module name collision? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Dependency: Import Paths] If Volo code imports mmt_v3::version expecting functional version control, could CI/CD tests pass against a mock but production fail against this stub? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Dependency: Version Mismatch] If Volo Vault was developed against a functional MMT v3 version module, could deploying with this stub cause immediate production failures when version checks abort? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Deployment: Module Loading] If this module is loaded during Volo Vault deployment, could the init abort prevent the entire package from being published successfully? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Deployment: Dependency Order] If Volo Vault modules depend on mmt_v3::version being initialized first, could init aborting cause cascade initialization failures across the entire protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Deployment: Upgrade Path] If this is a placeholder for a future upgrade, could its presence block the upgrade path because the module name is already claimed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Testing: destroy_version_for_testing] The only functional code is destroy_version_for_testing. Could this indicate the module is intended only for testing, but was accidentally included in production deployment? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Testing: Test Coverage] If tests mock version checks and always pass, could lack of integration tests against real version logic mask this stub's non-functionality until production? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Testing: Compilation Only] Could this module exist only to satisfy compilation dependencies, with the expectation that actual version checks happen through different mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Capability: VersionCap Usage] VersionCap is passed to upgrade_major, upgrade_minor, and set_version but never validated before abort. If implemented, could missing validation allow any VersionCap-like object to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Capability: Cap Duplication] VersionCap has store ability. Could it be cloned or duplicated, allowing multiple parties to perform version upgrades and creating version chaos? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Capability: Cap Revocation] No function exists to revoke or destroy VersionCap. If a malicious operator obtains the cap, could there be no way to remove their version control privileges? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Capability: Cap Verification] Upgrade functions take &VersionCap but don't extract or verify the UID. Could this allow passing any struct with a UID field, bypassing capability checks entirely? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Capability: Multiple Caps] init code suggests only one VersionCap is created. If multiple caps exist through bugs or exploits, could competing version managers cause inconsistent version states? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Logic: Major vs Minor] The code distinguishes major and minor versions but provides no logic for compatibility rules. Could this lead to implementations that break SemVer semantics, allowing breaking changes in minor updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Logic: Upgrade Order] upgrade_major doesn't increment major and reset minor to 0. If implemented without this logic, could minor versions continue incrementing across major boundaries, breaking version semantics? (Medium)"
