  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_looped()] [Same Reserve Check] The function checks if borrow and deposit have same reserve_array_index (lines 898-906) - but what about indirect loops like borrow A, deposit B, borrow B, deposit A? Are these detected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: is_looped()] [Loop Detection Bypass] If an attacker structures positions carefully with reserves not in target_reserve_array_indices, can they create effective loops that earn rewards but aren't detected by is_looped()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: zero_out_rewards()] [Permanent Reward Loss] When zero_out_rewards() is called for looped positions (lines 942-990), are rewards permanently lost or just temporarily paused? Can an attacker unloop to restore rewards and extract value? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: zero_out_rewards_if_looped()] [Check Timing] The function is called zero_out_rewards_if_looped() - when is this called? After every deposit/borrow? Can an attacker time their actions to earn rewards before detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: claim_rewards()] [Reward Index Validation] The reward_index parameter is passed to liquidity_mining::claim_rewards (line 637) - is this index validated to be within bounds? Can out-of-bounds access cause panics or incorrect reward claims? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: find_user_reward_manager_index()] [Linear Search] The function uses linear search through user_reward_managers vector (lines 1262-1274) - can an attacker create many user_reward_managers to cause DoS via O(n) search time on every operation? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: find_or_add_user_reward_manager()] [Manager Creation] The function creates new UserRewardManager if not found (lines 1287-1290) - can an attacker create unlimited reward managers by interacting with many different reserves, causing vector growth and DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: change_user_reward_manager_share()] [Share Calculation] The function is called with deposit.deposited_ctoken_amount or liability_shares(borrow) - can rounding differences cause reward accounting to drift from actual position sizes over time? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liability_shares()] [Division by Rate] The function divides borrowed_amount by cumulative_borrow_rate (lines 1054-1059) - can rate manipulation cause liability_shares to round to zero, enabling borrowing without proper reward accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: liability_shares()] [Floor Rounding] The result is floored to u64 - can this cause significant value loss when borrowed_amount is small relative to cumulative_borrow_rate? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: find_or_add_deposit()] [Deposit Creation] The function creates new Deposit with deposited_ctoken_amount = 0 (line 1248) - can zero-amount deposits cause issues with market_value calculations or reward accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: find_or_add_borrow()] [Borrow Initialization] New borrows are created with borrowed_amount = 0 and cumulative_borrow_rate from current reserve (lines 1219-1220) - can this rate be stale, causing incorrect compounding on first actual borrow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/obligation.move] [Function: find_deposit_index()] [Linear Search Performance] All find functions use linear search - with MAX_DEPOSITS = 5 and MAX_BORROWS = 5, is this acceptable, or can attackers exploit the O(n) complexity to cause gas spikes? (Low)"
