  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Address Format] Is there validation that fee_recipient is a valid Sui address format, or could an invalid address format cause issues in the Queue module? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [ID Handling] The QueueConfigsUpdated event includes queue.id(). Could there be ID collision or confusion if multiple Queue objects exist with similar configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Revocation] If an authority calls run() in the same transaction where their authority is being revoked by another authority, which action takes precedence? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Multi-Authority Conflict] If two authorities call run() with conflicting configs, is there any priority or does last-write-wins apply, potentially causing unexpected config flipping? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Authority Transfer During Execution] If Queue ownership is transferred mid-execution of run(), could the validation (which checks old authority) be inconsistent with actuate() execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event-State Synchronization] Could off-chain systems that listen to QueueConfigsUpdated events get out of sync with on-chain state if events are missed or processed out of order? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Cross-Module Testing] Has this action been tested with all possible Queue states, including edge cases like queues with zero oracles, deprecated queues, or queues mid-upgrade? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Fee Recipient Privacy] The QueueConfigsUpdated event publicly discloses fee_recipient address. Could this enable targeted attacks or privacy violations for oracle operators? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Configuration Visibility] All queue configs become publicly visible through events. Could competitors or attackers use this information to predict or manipulate oracle behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Sanity Checks] Beyond checking > 0, there are no sanity checks for reasonable ranges. Could min_attestations = 1000 and oracle_validity_length_ms = 1 create an effectively unusable queue? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Combination Validation] There's no validation of parameter combinations. Could fee = u64::MAX + min_attestations = u64::MAX together cause issues in oracle economics? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Relative Parameter Checks] Should min_attestations be validated relative to current oracle count in the queue, or can it exceed available oracles indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Public Function Risk] The validate() function is public but not entry. Could it be called by other modules to check authority without actually updating configs, enabling authority probing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Internal Function] The actuate() function is internal (not public). Could this prevent legitimate use cases where another module needs to actuate config changes programmatically? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Entry Function] The run() function is public entry, making it callable by EOAs. Should there be additional restrictions limiting calls to specific smart contracts only? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Previous Value Checks] There's no validation of previous config values. Could an attacker repeatedly toggle between two valid configs to create instability or exploit race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [No Rate Limiting] There's no rate limiting on config updates. Could an authority spam config changes to cause excessive gas costs or state churn? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [No Delta Validation] There's no validation of how much configs are changing. Could a sudden 1000x increase in min_attestations or fee cause operational disruption? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Queue Version Dependency] The check for EXPECTED_QUEUE_VERSION = 1 is rigid. If Queue module supports multiple versions, could this unnecessarily restrict updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Queue Method Trust] The actuate() function blindly trusts queue.set_configs() to work correctly. If set_configs() has bugs, could it corrupt queue state while this action appears to succeed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Has Authority Implementation] The has_authority() check is opaque. If Queue implements it incorrectly (e.g., always returns true), this entire security model breaks. (Critical)"
