  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Coin Type Asset Zero] Lines 288-292 have special handling for zero coin_type_asset_balance - if balance is 1 wei but treated as zero due to rounding, can operator steal dust amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/operation.move] [Function: end_op_with_bag()] [Op Value Update Flag] enable_op_value_update() at line 294 enables value update check - if this is called but end_op_value_update_with_bag is never called, does vault remain stuck in DURING_OPERATION? (High)",
