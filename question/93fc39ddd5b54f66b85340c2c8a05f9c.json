  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: Version] [Object Freezing] Should Version be frozen after deployment to prevent modification? If not, could unauthorized modifications occur despite VersionCap checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: VersionCap] [Cap Deletion] Could VersionCap be accidentally deleted using object::delete(), permanently preventing any future version upgrades for MMT v3 in Volo Protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_major()] [Overflow Risk] If upgrade_major() increments major_version without overflow checks, could major_version wrap from MAX_U64 to 0, appearing as a downgrade? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_minor()] [Overflow Risk] If upgrade_minor() sets minor_version to arbitrary val without bounds checking, could setting MAX_U64 cause overflow issues in version comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Arithmetic] [Comparison Overflow] If version comparison involves arithmetic operations (e.g., major*1000 + minor), could overflow cause incorrect version ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_major()] [Reentrancy] If upgrade_major() makes external calls before updating major_version, could reentrancy allow observing stale version state during upgrade? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: assert_supported_version()] [Cross-Contract Call] If called from Volo vault contracts during complex operations, could version checks create unexpected execution order dependencies? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Invariant: major >= 1] [Zero Version] Could Version be initialized or set with major_version = 0, which might be interpreted as 'no version' or 'invalid' in Volo Protocol checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Invariant: version immutability] [Version Stability] Should versions be immutable once set? If not, could mid-transaction version changes cause inconsistent behavior in Volo vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Invariant: upgrade ordering] [Non-Monotonic] If versions can be set to arbitrary values, could the system fail to maintain monotonically increasing versions required for security guarantees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Compatibility] [Cross-Version Safety] How does the version system ensure that Version 2.0 of MMT v3 remains compatible with Volo vault contracts expecting Version 1.x APIs? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: is_supported_major_version()] [Major Version Check] If is_supported_major_version() only checks equality (major == CURRENT_MAJOR), could it reject compatible newer major versions that maintain backward compatibility? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: is_supported_minor_version()] [Minor Version Check] If is_supported_minor_version() only checks minor >= CURRENT_MINOR, could it accept minor versions with breaking changes that violate Volo vault assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Migration] [Upgrade Hook] Does the version system provide hooks for migration logic when upgrading? If not, could data structures become incompatible after version changes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: set_version()] [Direct Version Set] Could set_version() skip necessary migration steps by allowing arbitrary version jumps, corrupting state in Volo vault dependencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Upgrade Rollback] [Failed Upgrade] If a version upgrade partially completes then fails, is there rollback logic? Or could the system be left in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: VersionUpgraded event] [Audit Trail] Without version upgrade events, could malicious version changes go undetected by Volo Protocol monitoring systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: VersionChecked event] [Monitoring] Without events when version checks occur, could systematic version compatibility issues be difficult to diagnose in Volo vault operations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Package Upgrade] [Version-Package Sync] If the Sui package is upgraded but Version object isn't updated, could there be mismatches between code version and declared version? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Upgrade Policy] [Breaking Change Management] How does the version system coordinate with Sui's package upgrade policies to ensure breaking changes are properly signaled to Volo Protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Trust Boundary] [VersionCap Trust] Does the system trust VersionCap holder completely, or are there additional checks (timelock, multi-sig) before version changes affect Volo Protocol? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Authority] [Decentralization] Is version control centralized under a single VersionCap? Could this create censorship or upgrade resistance risks for Volo Protocol users? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: Version(0,0)] [Zero Version] What happens if Version is initialized with major_version=0 and minor_version=0? Could this bypass version checks that assume non-zero versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: Version(MAX_U64, MAX_U64)] [Max Version] Could setting both versions to MAX_U64 break comparison logic or indicate 'any version accepted', bypassing security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Edge Case: Multiple Version Objects] [Version Proliferation] If multiple Version objects exist (e.g., from multiple init calls in different packages), which one is authoritative for Volo Protocol? (High)"
