  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: init()] [Deployment Failure] Since init() unconditionally aborts, would package deployment fail entirely, making MMT v3 unusable for Volo Protocol and blocking all vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Test Function: destroy_version_for_testing()] [Production Misuse] Could destroy_version_for_testing() be called in production to delete the Version object, causing permanent DoS for all MMT v3 version checks in Volo Protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: VersionCap] [Single Point of Failure] If only one VersionCap is created during init(), could loss or deletion of this capability permanently prevent version upgrades even when critical security patches are needed? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: init()] [VersionCap Distribution] If init() is implemented, how is VersionCap distributed? Could it be sent to an incorrect address, locking upgrade capabilities away from Volo Protocol administrators? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [All Functions] [Production Deployment] If this stub implementation with abort 0 in all functions is deployed to production, would it cause complete failure of MMT v3 integration in Volo Protocol, blocking all AMM-related vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: value_major()] [Unconditional Abort] Since value_major() always aborts, would any Volo vault code that queries the major version fail, preventing version compatibility checks and allowing incompatible operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: value_minor()] [Unconditional Abort] Since value_minor() always aborts, would version-dependent logic in Volo Protocol fail to execute, potentially allowing operations that should be gated by minor version checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_major()] [No-Op Implementation] If upgrade_major() aborts instead of incrementing major_version, could the protocol become stuck on an initial version even when upgrades are necessary for security fixes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_minor()] [No-Op Implementation] If upgrade_minor() aborts instead of setting the minor version, would the protocol be unable to deploy incremental updates without full redeployment? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: set_version()] [No-Op Implementation] If set_version() aborts, could emergency version hotfixes be impossible to deploy, leaving Volo Protocol vulnerable if critical MMT v3 bugs are discovered? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: is_supported_major_version()] [No-Op Implementation] If is_supported_major_version() aborts, would all version compatibility checks fail, causing DoS for legitimate vault operations that require version validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: is_supported_minor_version()] [No-Op Implementation] If is_supported_minor_version() aborts, could Volo vault adaptors be unable to verify MMT v3 compatibility, leading to use of incompatible versions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: assert_supported_version()] [No-Op Implementation] If assert_supported_version() aborts unconditionally, would all operations that use this assertion fail regardless of actual version compatibility? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: Version] [Object Deletion] If Version object is deleted while still referenced by Volo vault contracts, could it cause dangling references and transaction failures in version-dependent operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: VersionCap] [Key Ability] With 'key' ability, could VersionCap be accidentally transferred to a non-admin address through Sui transfer functions, permanently revoking upgrade privileges? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: VersionCap] [Store Ability] With 'store' ability, could VersionCap be stored in arbitrary objects/tables, making it difficult to track who has upgrade authority over MMT v3 versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Struct: Version] [Store Ability] With 'store' ability, could Version be wrapped in other objects, creating multiple version sources that could desynchronize and cause inconsistent version checks across Volo Protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: set_version()] [Version Downgrade] If set_version() allows setting lower major/minor values, could an attacker with VersionCap downgrade to a vulnerable MMT v3 version to exploit known bugs in Volo vault calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Function: upgrade_minor()] [Arbitrary Version] Could upgrade_minor(val: u64) allow setting minor_version to a value lower than current, effectively downgrading to a less secure version? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Version Comparison] [Downgrade Detection] If version comparison logic doesn't enforce monotonic increases, could the system fail to detect and prevent downgrades that reintroduce patched vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: current_major_version()] [Hardcoded Reference] If the expected current_major_version() constant/function is missing, how do is_supported_major_version() implementations know what version to compare against? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: current_minor_version()] [Hardcoded Reference] If the expected current_minor_version() constant/function is missing, could is_supported_minor_version() accept any minor version, bypassing security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: version_hash()] [Version Integrity] Without a version hash/checksum function, could code modifications go undetected even if major/minor versions remain unchanged? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [Missing: deprecation_checks()] [Deprecated Version Usage] Without deprecation tracking, could Volo Protocol continue using outdated MMT v3 versions that are no longer supported or secure? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/version.move] [MMT v3 Integration] [Module Mismatch] If other MMT v3 modules depend on version.move for compatibility checks but all functions abort, would the entire MMT v3 AMM system be non-functional for Volo vault integrations? (Critical)"
