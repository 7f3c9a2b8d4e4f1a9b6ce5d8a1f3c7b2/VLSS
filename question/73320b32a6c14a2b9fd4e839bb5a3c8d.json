  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker call update_single_price() with a malicious OracleConfig that passes version_verification but allows paused state manipulation, enabling price updates when system should be frozen? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Race Condition] If config::is_paused() check on line 56 is followed by a pause state change in another transaction before line 59 executes, can this TOCTOU enable unauthorized price updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Early Return Bypass] Lines 60-62 return early if price feed is disabled - can an attacker exploit timing by enabling feed, calling update_single_price, then disabling before transaction completes to bypass subsequent validations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [State Manipulation] If config::is_price_feed_enable() returns false on line 60, function returns without any event emission - can attacker disable feeds to prevent legitimate price updates and DoS price-dependent operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Logic Error] Early return on line 61 when feed disabled prevents any logging/events - can this hide critical state where feeds are maliciously disabled, allowing stale prices to persist undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timestamp Manipulation] clock::timestamp_ms(clock) on line 65 relies on Clock object - can attacker supply malicious Clock with manipulated timestamp to bypass freshness checks on line 84? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Integer Overflow] max_timestamp_diff retrieved on line 67 is added to updated_time in freshness check - can extremely large max_timestamp_diff cause overflow allowing stale prices to pass? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Silent Failure] Lines 75-76 return early if primary_oracle_provider is empty without emitting any event - can this be exploited to DoS price updates while appearing operational? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Configuration Attack] If provider::is_empty() check on line 75 can be bypassed by providing non-empty but invalid provider, does subsequent get_price_from_adaptor on line 83 properly validate? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Authorization Bypass] Lines 79-81 return silently when provider config disabled - comment says 'confirmed by administrator' but no event emission allows attacker to hide malicious disable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [State Inconsistency] If provider::is_oracle_provider_config_enable() returns false on line 79 but config was disabled mid-transaction, can this create inconsistent oracle state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Oracle Manipulation] get_price_from_adaptor() on line 83 returns (price, timestamp) - if Supra or Pyth oracle is compromised, can malicious price data propagate without additional validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Decimal Conversion Error] Line 83 passes decimal from line 71 to get_price_from_adaptor - if target_decimal conversion in adaptor fails/overflows, can incorrect price magnitudes be returned? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Freshness Bypass] strategy::is_oracle_price_fresh() on line 84 checks timestamp - if max_timestamp_diff is configured too large, can attacker use very stale prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Initialization Issue] Lines 87-90 initialize secondary price variables - if is_secondary_oracle_available is true but secondary config retrieval fails, can uninitialized values be used? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Logic Error] is_secondary_price_fresh initialized to false on line 87 but only set true if secondary available on line 91-94 - can this default false cause incorrect price selection logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Oracle Redundancy Bypass] If config::is_secondary_oracle_available() returns false on line 91, secondary_price remains 0 - can attacker disable secondary oracle to prevent price validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Validation Bypass] Lines 100-120 only validate price difference if BOTH prices fresh - if attacker can make one stale, does this skip critical difference validation allowing manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Manipulation] price_diff_threshold1 and price_diff_threshold2 retrieved on line 101 - if these thresholds are misconfigured or manipulated, can large price deviations pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timer Manipulation] diff_threshold2_timer retrieved on line 103 - can attacker manipulate this timer value to extend period where divergent prices are accepted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Severity Bypass] strategy::validate_price_difference() on line 104 returns severity - if severity calculation logic is flawed, can critical price deviations be marked as normal? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Event Only Security] Lines 106-117 emit PriceRegulation event when severity not normal - but if severity is level_warning (line 118), execution continues - can warning-level manipulation be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Logic Error] Line 118 returns if severity != level_warning but line 119 sets timer flag - if severity is exactly level_warning, timer starts but no return happens - is this safe?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timer Logic] start_or_continue_diff_threshold2_timer set true on line 119 when severity is warning - does this timer properly prevent price updates if divergence persists? (Medium)",
