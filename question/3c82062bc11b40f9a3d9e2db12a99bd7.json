  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Collateral Ratio] [Health Factor] If Navi health factor is computed using div() and compared with threshold, can precision loss cause healthy positions to appear unhealthy triggering incorrect liquidations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: LST Ratio] [Staking Exchange Rate] When computing LST/SUI exchange rate using div(total_staked, lst_supply), can supply being very small cause massive exchange rate enabling instant profit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: APY Calculation] [Compound Interest] If APY uses pow() with per-epoch rate, can overflow in pow() for high APY or many epochs cause abort preventing reward claims? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Loss Tolerance] [Threshold Check] If loss tolerance check uses sub(prev_value, current_value) and current > prev, does underflow abort prevent recognizing gains as acceptable? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Slippage Protection] [Expected Amount] When checking actual_amount >= expected_amount using ge(), can precision loss cause check to pass when actual < expected, bypassing slippage protection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Fee Caps] [Maximum Fee] If fee cap is enforced using min(calculated_fee, max_fee), can precision loss cause calculated_fee to exceed cap by small amount that compounds over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Boosted Balances] [Reward Multiplier] When applying boost multiplier using mul(), can overflow occur for users with very large balances and high boost factors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/decimal.move] [Integration: Validator Weights] [Weight Normalization] If validator weights are normalized using div(weight, total_weight), can total_weight being 0 cause division by zero in delegation logic? (Critical)"
