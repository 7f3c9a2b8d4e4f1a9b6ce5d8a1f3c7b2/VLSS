  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Version Check Coverage] Is there automated testing or static analysis ensuring every public entry function calls version_verification(), or could new functions be added without version checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Vault Protocol Sync] Since this is a local dependency in volo-vault, if volo-vault updates lending_core to a new version but some adaptors still use old version, can version mismatches cause adaptor failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Adaptor Version Isolation] Do Navi, Suilend, Cetus, and Momentum adaptors each interact with potentially different versions of lending_core, and could version conflicts cause protocol integration failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Health Limiter Version] Does the health limiter check lending_core version before querying Navi health factors, and could version mismatches cause incorrect health calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Failed Check Detection] When pre_check_version() fails, is there event emission or logging to alert operators of version mismatch, or do transactions silently fail leaving users confused? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Version Monitoring] Is there on-chain or off-chain monitoring of which Storage objects are at which versions, to ensure complete migration coverage after upgrades? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Input Validation] Does pre_check_version() validate that input v is within reasonable bounds (e.g., not u64::MAX), or could extreme values cause unexpected comparison behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: next_version()] [Semantic Gap] Is there documented meaning to version numbers (e.g., major.minor.patch encoding), or are they arbitrary sequential integers, and does this affect migration logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: this_version()] [Immutable Versions] Once a Storage object is created with a specific version, can its version field be modified outside of version_migrate(), and if so, could attackers forge version numbers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/version.move] [Function: pre_check_version()] [Batch Operations] If multiple Storage objects are accessed in a single transaction, are version checks performed for each one, or could one checked object provide access to unchecked objects? (High)"
