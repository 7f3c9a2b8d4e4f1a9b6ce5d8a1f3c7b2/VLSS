  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: add() vs wrapping_add()] [Semantic Confusion] Similar names but different overflow behavior - if vault developer confuses these, could overflow checks be missing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: sub() vs wrapping_sub()] [Semantic Confusion] Similar names but different underflow behavior - if vault uses wrapping_sub assuming it aborts, could silent wrapping occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Struct: I32] [Direct Field Access] bits field is not private - if vault code directly reads/writes I32::bits bypassing constructor, could create invalid values? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Test Coverage] [Missing Tests] No tests for or(), and() bitwise operations - if these are used for vault status flags, could bugs go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Test Coverage] [Missing Tests] No tests for sign() and is_neg() edge cases like zero - if vault relies on these for balance checks, could zero handling be wrong? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Test Coverage] [Missing Tests] No tests for gte() and lte() boundary conditions - if vault uses these for range checks, could off-by-one errors exist? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Test Coverage] [Missing Tests] No tests for as_u32() on negative values - if this is supposed to abort but doesn't, could negative values leak to u32 context? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Deployment] [Module Initialization] All functions abort - if module initializer or genesis uses i32 math, could initial deployment fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Deployment] [Dependency Resolution] Module is in local_dependencies - if Sui resolver picks different version of mmt_v3::i32 from another package, could version conflict occur? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Migration] [Upgrade Path] If working implementation replaces this stub, could existing I32 values in storage become incompatible if bit representation changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Migration] [Data Validity] If vault has stored I32 values created by old working code, could new implementation interpret bits differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Documentation] [Missing Spec] No comments explaining two's complement representation - could future maintainer misunderstand bit layout? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Documentation] [Missing Invariants] No documented invariants about valid range - could vault code create out-of-range values? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Documentation] [Ambiguous Behavior] No spec for edge cases like MIN/-1 division - could implementation differ from expectations? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: from()] [Zero Handling] from(0) should succeed per test - if implementation treats 0 specially, could vault zero-balance initialization fail? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/mmt_v3/sources/i32.move] [Function: neg_from()] [Zero Negation] neg_from(0) should equal 0 per test - if implementation produces non-zero, could vault neutral operations corrupt state? (Medium)"
