  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_secondary_oracle_provider()] [Secondary Manipulation] Can an attacker set secondary provider to one they control, then manipulate primary to fail, forcing fallback to attacker's manipulated secondary prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_secondary_oracle_provider()] [Empty Secondary Attack] Can an attacker set secondary to empty, then attack primary provider, leaving no fallback and causing price unavailability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Partial Migration] If version_migrate succeeds for oracle_config but fails for price_oracle, can the system operate with mismatched versions causing undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Migration Replay] Can an attacker call version_migrate multiple times to cause version number overflow or reset version checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Migration Without Pause] Can an attacker exploit the fact that version_migrate doesn't pause the oracle, allowing operations to continue during migration with inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_pyth_oracle_provider_config()] [Empty Pair ID] Can an attacker provide empty vector<u8> for pair_id, causing Pyth lookups to fail silently or return zero prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pyth_price_oracle_provider_pair_id()] [Pair ID Swap During Active Use] Can an attacker change pair_id while the provider is actively being queried, causing mid-transaction price source switch? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_supra_oracle_provider_config()] [Invalid u32 Pair ID] Can an attacker provide u32 pair_id that doesn't correspond to any Supra feed, causing queries to fail or return garbage? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_supra_price_source_pair_id()] [Vector<u8> Manipulation] Can an attacker provide vector<u8> that encodes to valid but wrong Supra pair_id after conversion? (Medium)"
