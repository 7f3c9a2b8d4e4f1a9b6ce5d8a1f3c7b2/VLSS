  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: check_version()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker interact with oracle functions after a version upgrade but before check_version() is called, potentially using deprecated logic paths that bypass security checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Version Manipulation] Can an attacker call upgrade_oracle_config() multiple times to manipulate the version field, potentially skipping critical migration logic or downgrading to a vulnerable version? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Race Condition] If upgrade_oracle_config() is called concurrently with price update operations, can this lead to inconsistent state where some operations use old version logic while others use new version logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: check_version()] [DoS Attack] Can an attacker prevent legitimate oracle operations by manipulating the version field to cause check_version() assertions to fail, effectively DoS'ing the entire vault system? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: upgrade_oracle_config()] [Access Control] The upgrade function only checks version < VERSION but doesn't verify caller identity - can any external caller with package access trigger upgrades at inappropriate times, disrupting active vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Parameter Manipulation] Can an attacker with package access set update_interval to 0, causing all price staleness checks in get_asset_price() to pass regardless of actual price age, enabling stale price exploitation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Economic Attack] Can an operator set update_interval to an extremely large value (e.g., u64::MAX), allowing prices to remain valid indefinitely and enabling price manipulation attacks on the vault? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Staleness Check Bypass] With update_interval set to MAX_UPDATE_INTERVAL (60 seconds), can an attacker exploit the 1-minute window to execute operations with outdated prices during high volatility periods? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_update_interval()] [Missing Bounds] No maximum or minimum bounds are enforced on update_interval - can this be set to 1 millisecond, causing all price reads to fail and DoS the vault system? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_current_price()] [Time Window Attack] The staleness check uses (now - max_timestamp < config.update_interval) but doesn't handle clock manipulation - can an attacker exploit clock.timestamp_ms() to pass stale prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Economic Attack] Can an operator set dex_slippage to 0, causing DEX adaptor operations to fail due to zero slippage tolerance, effectively DoS'ing DEX-related vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Parameter Validation] No upper bound exists for dex_slippage - can setting it to u256::MAX enable 100%+ slippage, allowing attackers to drain vault funds via manipulated DEX trades? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: set_dex_slippage()] [Front-Running Attack] Can an attacker front-run vault DEX operations by manipulating dex_slippage just before a swap, causing the vault to accept unfavorable exchange rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: dex_slippage()] [Missing Validation] The getter returns raw dex_slippage without validation - can downstream adaptors misinterpret values like u256::MAX as acceptable slippage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Integer Overflow] The diff() operation on last_updated.diff(now) could overflow if last_updated > now - can clock manipulation cause this check to pass with stale prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Missing Asset Type Validation] The function doesn't validate asset_type format - can an attacker query prices for non-existent or malformed asset types, causing unexpected behavior in vault logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Race Condition] Between the staleness check and returning price, can another transaction update the price, leading to TOCTOU where the returned price is not what was validated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [DoS via Staleness] If the Switchboard aggregator fails to update within update_interval, all vault operations dependent on this price will fail - can this be weaponized for DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_asset_price()] [Precision Loss] Prices are stored as u256 but source aggregators may have different precision - can precision loss during conversions lead to price manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Integer Overflow] When decimals < 9, the multiplication price * pow(10, 9 - decimals) can overflow u256 for high prices - can this cause operations to fail or return incorrect prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Integer Underflow] When decimals > 9, the division price / pow(10, decimals - 9) can lose precision - can this undervalue assets and enable theft via underpriced withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Decimal Boundary] What happens when decimals == 9? The function returns price unchanged, but was the original staleness check in get_asset_price() applied? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Rounding Error] Division for decimals > 9 truncates towards zero - can repeated operations amplify rounding errors, enabling gradual asset drain? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Decimal Manipulation] Can an attacker add an aggregator with extreme decimals (0 or 255) to cause overflow/underflow in pow() calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/oracle.move] [Function: get_normalized_asset_price()] [Missing Bounds Check] No validation that decimals is reasonable (e.g., 0-18) - can setting decimals to 255 cause pow(10, 255-9) to overflow and panic? (High)"
