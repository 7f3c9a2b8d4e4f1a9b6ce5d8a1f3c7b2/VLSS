  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a non-friend module call version_migrate() through a proxy pattern or inheritance to upgrade the version without proper authorization, bypassing version checks and allowing outdated oracle data to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_config()] [Access Control] Since new_config() is a friend function that creates a shared object, can an attacker exploit the timing window between object creation and share_object() call to gain unauthorized access to the OracleConfig before it's properly initialized? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Authorization] If set_pause() is called by an unauthorized friend module, can the paused state be manipulated to either DoS the entire oracle system or allow operations when the system should be paused? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Module-level] [Friend Function Security] Since only oracle_pro, oracle_manage, and oracle_dynamic_getter are trusted friends, can a malicious module with similar naming conventions trick the compiler or runtime into gaining friend access? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_pause()] [State Manipulation] Can an attacker call set_pause(true) during critical price updates to freeze the oracle, causing stale prices to be used in vault operations leading to incorrect valuations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: is_paused()] [Race Condition] If is_paused() is checked before an operation but set_pause() is called during execution, can operations proceed with stale prices when the system should be paused? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_pause()] [DoS] Can repeated toggling of the paused flag cause event spam or state inconsistencies that DoS price feed operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [Duplicate Detection Bypass] Since is_price_feed_exists() checks both coin_type and oracle_id, can an attacker create duplicate feeds by using the same coin_type with different oracle_ids, causing price feed conflicts? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: is_price_feed_exists()] [Logic Error] The function returns true if EITHER coin_type OR oracle_id matches - should it require BOTH to match? This allows creating feeds with same coin but different ID or same ID but different coin, violating uniqueness. (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [Parameter Validation] Can an attacker create a price feed with maximum_effective_price < minimum_effective_price during initialization, since validation only occurs in setters but not in constructor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [Threshold Validation] Can price_diff_threshold2 be set lower than price_diff_threshold1 during initialization, as no validation exists in the constructor? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [Initial State Attack] Since enable defaults to true and primary/secondary default to empty providers, can a price feed be exploited immediately after creation before proper providers are configured? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [History Initialization] Since history.price and history.updated_time both default to 0, can this cause division-by-zero or undefined behavior in price calculation functions that depend on historical data? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: new_price_feed()] [Timer Initialization] With diff_threshold2_timer defaulting to 0, can an attacker manipulate the first timer start to bypass duration checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_oracle_id_to_price_feed()] [ID Collision] Can an attacker change a feed's oracle_id to match another existing feed's ID, causing oracle routing conflicts and price data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_oracle_id_to_price_feed()] [Variable Shadowing] The function uses feed_id parameter in the loop (line 369) but also iterates with feed_id from vec_feeds - does this shadow the parameter and skip checking the target feed itself? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: is_price_feed_exists()] [Inconsistent Checks] Lines 266-268 check coin_type equality but lines 269-271 check oracle_id - why the OR logic instead of AND? Can this allow unauthorized duplicate creation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_oracle_id_to_price_feed()] [Race Condition] If two set_oracle_id calls execute concurrently with the same target value, can both pass the uniqueness check but violate the one-oracle-id-per-feed invariant? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed()] [Conditional Validation] Line 300 only validates threshold1 <= threshold2 if threshold2 > 0 - can threshold2=0 bypass this check and create invalid threshold ordering? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold2_to_price_feed()] [Invariant Violation] If threshold1 is updated after threshold2 is set to a lower value, can the invariant threshold1 <= threshold2 be violated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed()] [Zero Value Attack] Can both thresholds be set to 0, effectively disabling price deviation detection and allowing any price change? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed()] [Max Value Attack] Can thresholds be set to u64::MAX to effectively disable deviation checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_maximum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Bound Validation] Can maximum_effective_price be set to u256::MAX, making the upper bound check meaningless? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_minimum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Conditional Check] Line 350 only validates minimum <= maximum if maximum > 0 - can maximum=0 allow minimum to be set arbitrarily high, creating invalid bounds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/config.move] [Function: set_minimum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Zero Bounds] Can both minimum and maximum be set to 0, making all prices invalid and DoSing the price feed? (High)"
