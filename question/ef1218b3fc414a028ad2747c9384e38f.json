  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()] [Boosted Rewards] When calculating boosted rewards as mul(base_rewards, boost_multiplier), can overflow allow an attacker to trigger DoS on reward distribution for boosted users only? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: sub()] [Request Buffer] When canceling withdrawal requests using sub(buffer_amount, canceled_amount), can precision errors from previous calculations cause canceled_amount to exceed buffer_amount by 1 wei, reverting legitimate cancellations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()/add()] [Multi-Asset Value] When summing vault assets from multiple protocols (Navi + Suilend + Cetus + Momentum) using add(add(add(a,b),c),d), can nested operations overflow even if individual values are safe? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()] [Oracle Price] When normalizing Switchboard oracle prices from different decimals using div(price, decimal_factor), can division by inflated decimal_factor cause prices to round to zero, breaking vault valuations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()] [Fee BPS] When calculating fees as mul(amount, fee_bps) then div by 10000, can the mul() overflow for large deposits even though fee_bps is capped at 10000, preventing large deposits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: sub()] [Loss Tolerance] When checking if losses exceed tolerance using sub(prev_value, curr_value) > loss_tolerance, can the sub() revert prevent loss detection, allowing operations to continue despite violating loss limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: min()/sub()] [Withdrawal Cap] When limiting withdrawals to available liquidity using min(requested, available), then sub(vault_balance, withdrawn), can the combination allow withdrawing more than available if min() returns unchecked value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()] [Health Factor] In health limiter integration, when div(collateral, debt) calculates health factor, can division rounding cause health factor to be 1 wei below threshold, incorrectly blocking healthy operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()/div()] [Asset Conversion] When converting asset amounts between protocols with different decimals using mul(amount, conversion_rate) then div(result, precision), can intermediate overflow in mul() prevent valid conversions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: add()] [Validator Weight] When updating validator weights using add(existing_weight, new_delegation), can overflow allow an attacker to cause weight updates to fail, permanently skewing delegation distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mod()/div()] [Reward Distribution] If reward distribution uses div(total_rewards, num_users) + mod(total_rewards, num_users) to handle remainder, can the remainder be lost or stolen by the operator? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: add()] [MAX_U256] Can adding 1 to MAX_U256 pass the overflow check 'c >= a' due to wrapping making c=0, which is < a, but only after the addition has corrupted the state? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()] [MAX_U256] When both a and b are MAX_U256, can the multiplication wrap multiple times such that c/a still equals b due to mathematical coincidence, bypassing overflow detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: sub()] [Equal Values] When a == b, sub() returns 0 - can this edge case cause issues in percentage calculations where div(sub(a,b), a) would expect non-zero numerator? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: div()] [One Wei] When dividing small amounts by large numbers (e.g., div(1, 1000000)), the result rounds to zero - can this cause issues in share calculations where users receive 0 shares for small deposits?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: mul()] [Powers of Two] When multiplying by powers of 2 (mul(amount, 2^n)), can this be optimized to left shift for gas savings while maintaining safety checks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: min()] [Equal Values] When x == y, min() returns x - can this assumption cause issues if the calling code expects deterministic behavior or needs to know which input was selected? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: add()] [Zero Addition] When adding 0 to any value, the check 'c >= a' is trivially true - can this allow skipping validation that should occur on the second parameter? (Low)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/safe_math.move] [Function: Missing] [Square Root] The module lacks safe sqrt() function - if vault code implements custom sqrt for LP token calculations without overflow checks, can this introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
