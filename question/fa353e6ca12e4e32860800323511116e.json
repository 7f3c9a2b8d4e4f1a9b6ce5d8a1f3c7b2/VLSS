  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [Repay Amount Overflow] If amount parameter at line 76 is u256::MAX, can it cause overflow in subsequent repayment logic not visible in this validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_repay()] [Missing Supply Balance Update] validate_repay doesn't check if repayment will exceed maximum supply after adding back to pool - can it bypass supply caps? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_liquidate()] [Loan Type Mismatch] If type_name comparison for LoanCointype at line 82 passes with manipulated string, can attacker liquidate with wrong debt asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_liquidate()] [Collateral Type Exploit] If CollateralCoinType at line 83 matches string but is wrapped/different asset, can liquidator seize wrong collateral? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_liquidate()] [Same Asset Liquidation] Does validate_liquidate allow debt_asset == collateral_asset at lines 82-83? Can this enable same-asset liquidation exploits? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_liquidate()] [Zero Amount Liquidation] Line 84 blocks zero amount, but can amount=1 minimal liquidations be used for griefing or front-running? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Function: validate_liquidate()] [No Liquidator Authorization] validate_liquidate doesn't check if liquidator is authorized - can anyone liquidate any position? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Cross-Function] [Storage Mutation Safety] All validation functions take &mut Storage but only read - can concurrent transactions mutate storage during validation causing race conditions? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/validation.move] [Cross-Function] [Amount Parameter Type] All functions use u256 for amount - can extremely large u256 values cause overflow in ray_math operations? (High)",
