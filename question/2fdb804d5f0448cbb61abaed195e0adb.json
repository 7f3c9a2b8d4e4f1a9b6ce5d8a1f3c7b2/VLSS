  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Event Integrity] The FlashLoan event is emitted with user-provided _user address - could an attacker specify fake addresses to pollute event logs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Event Timing] The FlashRepay event is emitted after all operations complete - if an earlier operation fails, the event isn't emitted, but could observers miss partial state changes? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_config()] [Event Spamming] Can an attacker create many configs to spam ConfigCreated events and obscure legitimate events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Event Spamming] Can an attacker create many assets to spam AssetConfigCreated events for DoS or log analysis attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Type Parameter] The function is generic over CoinType - can an attacker pass a malicious type that passes checks but behaves unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Type Mismatch] The receipt is typed Receipt<CoinType> - if an attacker somehow obtains a receipt with wrong type parameter, could this bypass type safety? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Type Confusion] If CoinType in loan() differs from CoinType in repay() due to type casting or wrapping, could this allow cross-asset exploitation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Module: flash_loan] [Friend Access] Only lending_core::manage and lending_core::lending are friends - if these modules are compromised, could they abuse create_config, create_asset, loan, repay functions? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Module: flash_loan] [Friend Expansion] If additional modules are added as friends in future versions, could this expand attack surface without proper auditing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Friend Abuse] Since loan() is friend-only, can friend modules bypass normal access controls to extract loans without proper authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Friend Abuse] Since repay() is friend-only, can friend modules repay loans on behalf of other users to manipulate accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Pool Withdraw] The pool::withdraw_balance() call passes _user - if this function has vulnerabilities, could attackers drain pools via flash loans? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Pool Deposit] The pool::deposit_balance() call might have vulnerabilities - if it fails silently, could funds be lost without detection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Treasury Deposit] The pool::deposit_treasury() call handles fees - if this function has vulnerabilities, could attackers redirect treasury fees? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Pool Normal Amount] The pool::normal_amount() transformation might have bugs - if it returns incorrect values, could fee calculations be manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Storage Update] The logic::update_state_of_all() call updates all storage state - if this fails, does the entire transaction rollback or can partial updates persist? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Index Retrieval] The storage::get_index() call returns (supply_index, _) - if supply_index is 0, does ray_math::ray_div() handle this safely? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Supply Index Cumulation] The logic::cumulate_to_supply_index() modifies storage - if called with manipulated scaled_fee_to_supplier, could this corrupt storage state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Interest Rate Update] The logic::update_interest_rate() modifies rates - if flash loan volume is extreme, could this cause rate manipulation or instability? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Reserve Count] The storage::get_reserves_count() might return stale or incorrect count - could this cause missed assets or out-of-bounds access? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: get_storage_asset_id_from_coin_type()] [Coin Type Retrieval] The storage::get_coin_type() might return incorrect type due to corruption - could this cause wrong asset matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Clock Dependency] The function requires Clock parameter for logic::update_state_of_all() - can an attacker manipulate clock or use stale clock to exploit rate calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Timestamp Manipulation] If block timestamps can be manipulated, could this allow attackers to repay at favorable interest rates? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Fee Arbitrage] If rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury is less than FlashLoanMultiple(), the gap is profit for users - could attackers exploit this for risk-free returns? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Liquidity Mining] Can attackers repeatedly take flash loans just to generate fee_to_supplier rewards, farming supply index growth without providing real liquidity? (Medium)"
