  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Precision Loss] Does the ceiling division formula on line 178 lose precision for small sui_amount_out values, causing systematic over-redemption that drains lst_balance over many operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Ratio Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate total_sui_supply or total_lst_supply through external liquid_staking interactions to inflate lst_to_redeem calculation, extracting excess value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Subtraction Underflow] If total_sui_supply < staker.liabilities + MIST_PER_SUI on line 141, can the else branch return 0 even when fees are legitimately owed, causing fee loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Arithmetic Error] Can the excess_sui calculation on line 142 underflow if staker.liabilities increases between total_sui_supply computation and the subtraction, causing a panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: total_sui_supply()] [Overflow] Can staker.liquid_staking_info.total_sui_supply() + staker.sui_balance.value() overflow u64 on line 46, causing wraparound and breaking invariant checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Rounding Attack] Can an attacker call withdraw() with amount = sui_balance + 1 repeatedly to trigger minimal unstake_n_sui() calls with ceiling rounding, slowly draining extra value from lst_balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: unstake_n_sui()] [Edge Case] When total_sui_supply - 1 == sui_amount_out * total_lst_supply / total_sui_supply, does the +total_sui_supply-1 term cause lst_to_redeem to round up by 2 instead of 1, over-redeeming LST? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Invariant Violation] Although claim_fees() checks total_sui_supply() >= liabilities on line 154, can race conditions between refresh() and the check allow the invariant to be violated before the assertion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Invariant Bypass] If unstake_n_sui() on line 149 fails silently or returns less SUI than expected, can excess_sui still be split out, breaking the invariant that total_sui_supply >= liabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: withdraw()] [Invariant Missing] Why doesn't withdraw() verify total_sui_supply() >= liabilities after withdrawing, allowing scenarios where liabilities exceed actual backing to persist undetected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: deposit()] [Invariant Missing] Since deposit() increases liabilities without checking if total_sui_supply will remain >= liabilities + sui.value(), can deposits break the invariant when sui_balance is low? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Invariant Risk] After rebalance() converts all sui_balance to lst_balance and stakes it, if the validator slash event occurs, can total_sui_supply drop below liabilities permanently? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Struct: Staker] [Invariant Design] Should there be an invariant check that lst_balance value in SUI terms + sui_balance >= liabilities, and if not, can negative equity scenarios persist undetected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: total_sui_supply()] [Stale Value Attack] Can an attacker exploit the staleness of total_sui_supply() by calling it before refresh() to get outdated exchange rates for deposit/withdraw operations, extracting value through arbitrage?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: claim_fees()] [Stale Calculation] Since total_sui_supply is computed on line 138 after refresh but excess_sui depends on it, if another transaction modifies state before unstake_n_sui(), can excess_sui become incorrect?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/staker.move] [Function: rebalance()] [Threshold Bypass] Can an attacker front-run rebalance() by withdrawing SUI to keep sui_balance just below MIN_DEPLOY_AMOUNT, preventing legitimate rebalancing and causing inefficient capital allocation?
