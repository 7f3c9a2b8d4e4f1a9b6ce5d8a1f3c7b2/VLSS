  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_balance()] [Bag vs Table Sync] At line 360-363, balance is added to Bag while amount at line 365-366 is added to Table - can these become desynchronized? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: claim_reward()] [Balance Deduction] At line 638, balance is split but reward_amounts table is not decremented - can reward_amounts become inflated? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Multi-Structure Init] At lines 245-247, reward type is added to balances, amounts, and indices - can partial initialization cause inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: remove_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Partial Removal] At lines 326-327, buffer amounts and distributions are removed - can one succeed and other fail leaving inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffer()] [Buffer to Main Sync] When buffer distributes rewards via update_reward_indices at line 530, does reward_amounts table in main rewards get updated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_reward_to_buffer()] [Dual Amount Update] At lines 398-399, buffer amount is updated, and at line 405 balance is joined - can these be inconsistent if transaction partially fails? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: retrieve_undistributed_reward()] [Buffer vs Balance Deduction] At line 684-685, buffer amount is decremented but at line 698 balance is split - can mismatch cause imbalance? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_indices()] [Index vs Amount Sync] At line 580, reward_indices are updated but reward_amounts at line 136 may not reflect distribution - can these diverge? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: create_reward_buffer_distribution()] [Buffer Init State] At lines 291-300, buffer is initialized - can this be called after rewards already exist causing state mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: add_new_reward_type()] [Buffer Optional Init] At lines 249-260, buffer distribution is optionally created - can missing buffer cause issues if add_reward_to_buffer is called later? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/reward_manager.move] [Function: update_reward_buffers()] [Partial Loop Execution] At lines 459-461, all buffers are updated in loop - if loop partially executes, are some buffers stale? (High)"
