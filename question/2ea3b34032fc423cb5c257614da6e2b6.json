  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Level] [Package Visibility] Does package-level visibility for mutation functions create a trust boundary issue if liquid_staking package grows to include untrusted modules? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Field Access] Can parent modules directly access Manage fields using dot notation, bypassing check_version() and check_not_paused() guards? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: new()] [Constructor Pattern] Is there any validation preventing package modules from creating malicious Manage instances to inject into shared objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Test Coverage] Are there tests verifying behavior when self.version > VERSION, = VERSION, and < VERSION? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Test Coverage] Are there tests verifying both paused=true and paused=false code paths and error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Test Coverage] Are there tests verifying edge cases like version=0, version=u64::MAX, and version=VERSION? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Gas Optimization] Does calling check_version() in every operation add unnecessary gas costs, and can this be exploited for griefing? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [DoS] Can an admin repeatedly toggle pause state to DoS users who have pending transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Gas Griefing] Can rapid pause/unpause cycles cause gas griefing for operations that cache pause state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Recovery Path] If migration fails mid-process, is there a recovery mechanism to restore previous version state? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Error Recovery] If check_version() fails, can operations be retried after migrate_version(), or are funds permanently locked? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Emergency Stop] Is paused=true sufficient for emergency stop, or are there scenarios where operations can bypass pause checks? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Breaking Changes] If VERSION increments from 2 to 3 with breaking changes, will check_version() prevent all operations until migration? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Data Migration] Does migrate_version() handle data structure changes, or only version number updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Backward Compatibility] Can version checks be relaxed for backward-compatible changes, or is strict equality always required? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Call Pattern] Is check_version() always called before check_not_paused() in parent modules, or can order be reversed enabling attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Event Emission] Does set_paused() emit events, or is event emission only in parent modules, potentially causing event inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Struct: Manage] [Composition] If Manage is composed into multiple structs beyond StakePool and ValidatorPool, can this cause version/pause state divergence? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_paused()] [Two-Step Pattern] Should set_paused() use a two-step commit pattern for critical pause operations, preventing accidental misconfigurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Timelock] Should migrate_version() be timelocked to prevent rushed upgrades that could introduce vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Module Level] [Formal Verification] Have version and pause state machines been formally verified for all possible state transitions? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_version()] [Multi-Pool Scenario] If user interacts with StakePool v2 and ValidatorPool v1 in same transaction, can version mismatch cause state corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: migrate_version()] [Atomic Migration] Can migrate_version() be called atomically on all pools (StakePool + ValidatorPool), or can partial migration leave system inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Constant: VERSION] [Shared Constant] Since VERSION is module-level constant, can different pools have different versions if managed by different admins? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/manage.move] [Function: check_not_paused()] [Granularity] Does binary pause (true/false) provide sufficient granularity, or should there be operation-specific pause states? (Medium)"
