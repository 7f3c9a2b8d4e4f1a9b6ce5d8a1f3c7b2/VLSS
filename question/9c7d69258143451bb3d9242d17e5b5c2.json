  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: stake_pool_for_testing()] [Unauthorized Staking] stake_pool_for_testing() at line 685 directly stakes pending without deprecation check - if exposed in production, can it bypass E_DEPRECATED abort? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: change_staked_value()] [Accounting Manipulation] change_staked_value() at line 639 allows arbitrary staked value changes - if this test-only function is accessible, can attackers corrupt total_staked table completely? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: test_update_version()] [Version Downgrade] test_update_version() at line 612 allows arbitrary version setting - can this be used to downgrade version and bypass version checks in production? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_for_testing()] [Test Unstake Path] If unstake_for_testing() at line 705 is included in production, does it provide an alternative path to unstake that bypasses fee calculations or ratio checks? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: add_total_staked_for_testing()] [Direct Staked Manipulation] add_total_staked_for_testing() at line 335 exposes add_total_staked_unsafe() - can this be used to inflate staked amounts without actual SUI backing? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_ticket_supply()] [Metadata Exposure] get_ticket_supply() at line 236 is test-only but exposes unstake_ticket metadata - can external calls to this reveal internal ticket accounting for exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: test_migrate()] [Migration Bypass] test_migrate() at line 607 exposes the internal migrate() function - can this be called to force premature migration during critical operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_total_stake_of()] [Validator Query Exploit] Although test-only, does get_total_stake_of() at line 231 reveal information that allows attackers to target specific validators for unstaking attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Validator Exhaustion] At line 443, validator_set::remove_stakes() is called - if a validator has insufficient stake, can this cause partial unstaking and leave users with incomplete redemptions? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Validator List Manipulation] The validators vector is passed as parameter - can a malicious caller pass an empty vector or invalid addresses to cause E_NOTHING_TO_UNSTAKE or bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_validator_set()] [Validator Set Corruption] mut_validator_set() at line 540 returns mutable reference - can package functions modify validator_set in ways that break staking invariants? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Init Function] [Validator Set Empty] At line 172, validator_set is created empty - does this cause immediate failure on first stake attempt if no validators are added before staking? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Dynamic Field Collision] If CAP_CREATED dynamic field at line 599 is added, can subsequent code check for its existence and skip critical validations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Abort Error Code] mark_cap_created() aborts with error code 0 if field exists - is this error code used elsewhere, causing ambiguous error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mark_cap_created()] [Race Condition] Can two concurrent package functions both check !exists_() at line 600 and both try to add, causing one to abort unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_staked()] [Event Spoofing] emit_staked() at line 568 is package-level - can malicious package functions emit false StakedEvent with incorrect amounts, misleading off-chain systems? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_unstaked()] [Event Forgery] emit_unstaked() at line 576 can be called by package functions - can this be used to forge unstake events without actual unstaking, confusing auditing systems? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: emit_ratio()] [Ratio Event Manipulation] emit_ratio() at line 584 emits RatioUpdatedEvent - can package functions emit false ratio updates to manipulate external oracles or UI displays? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_pending()] [Pending Coin Theft] mut_pending() at line 594 returns mutable Coin<SUI> reference - can package functions extract SUI from pending without updating total_staked, causing accounting mismatch? (Critical)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: mut_collected_rewards()] [Reward Fee Theft] mut_collected_rewards() returns mutable u64 - can package functions set collected_rewards to 0 after fees are collected, double-spending protocol fees? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: calculate_reward_fee()] [Multiplication Overflow] Does math::mul_div() at line 215 properly handle the case where value * base_reward_fee overflows u64 before division by MAX_PERCENT? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: calculate_unstake_fee()] [Precision Loss] With base_unstake_fee=5 (0.05%), does calculate_unstake_fee() at line 227 lose precision for small amounts, making micro-unstakes fee-free? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_ratio()] [u256 Overflow] Can the u256 ratio in get_ratio() overflow if cert_supply is near MAX and (staked+rewards-tickets) is very large? (Low)",
