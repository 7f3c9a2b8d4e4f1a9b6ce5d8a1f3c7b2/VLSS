  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Guardian Self-Attestation] Can a guardian oracle attest for itself by passing the same object as both oracle and guardian parameters at lines 44, 46, creating circular attestations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Enable Oracle Idempotency] If enable_oracle at line 123 is not idempotent and run() is called multiple times after threshold is reached, can repeated enablement corrupt oracle state or expiration times? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: run()] [Parameter Ordering] The parameter order in run() at lines 136-143 must match validate() and actuate() - can parameter confusion lead to passing wrong objects to validation or actuation functions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate() vs actuate()] [State Assumption] Validate at line 43 takes &mut Oracle but actuate at line 95 also takes &mut Oracle - can validate modify state that actuate depends on, creating inconsistent execution? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Missing Actuation Checks] Validate only checks signature and timeouts but doesn't verify oracle state - can oracles in invalid states (e.g., already enabled) pass validation and cause issues in actuate? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Constants: ATTESTATION_VALIDITY_MS] [Time Window] The 10-minute validity window (line 41: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 10) seems incorrect (36000000ms = 10 hours, not 10 minutes) - can this extended window allow replay attacks or stale attestations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Constants: EXPECTED_ORACLE_VERSION] [Version Lock] EXPECTED_ORACLE_VERSION = 1 at line 10 - can this prevent legitimate protocol upgrades, or allow version 1 oracles with known vulnerabilities to continue operating? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Error Codes] [Assertion Failures] All validations use assertions (lines 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 92) that abort transactions - can assertion failures leak sensitive information about oracle state or configuration? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Error: EGuardianInvalid] [Misleading Error] Line 67 uses EGuardianInvalid but checks oracle expiration, not guardian - can this error message confusion lead to incorrect debugging or security assumptions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Error Handling] [No Partial Success] If validation passes but actuate fails, the entire transaction aborts - can this create scenarios where valid attestations are lost due to temporary actuation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Timestamp Units Confusion] The parameter is timestamp_seconds at line 47 but it's multiplied by 1000 at line 73 to convert to milliseconds - can caller confusion about units lead to timestamps being off by 1000x? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Timestamp Precision Loss] Converting timestamp_seconds to milliseconds at line 107 assumes second-level precision - can sub-second timestamp variations cause attestation collisions or ordering issues?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Clock Drift] The comparison at line 73 relies on clock.timestamp_ms() being accurate - can clock drift or manipulation across validators create inconsistent attestation acceptance? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Signature Recovery ID] The hardcoded recovery_id=1 at line 88 may not be correct for all signatures - can valid signatures with recovery_id 0, 2, or 3 be incorrectly rejected? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Compressed Pubkey Format] Line 88 returns compressed pubkey which is then decompressed at line 89 - can this two-step process introduce vulnerabilities if intermediate format is manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Pubkey Offset] The check_subvec at line 92 starts comparison at offset 1 - is this intentionally skipping the first byte of the pubkey, and can this be exploited?
