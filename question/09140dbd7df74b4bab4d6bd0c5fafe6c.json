  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Value Manipulation] When Volo Vault calls the aggregator to get asset prices for total_usd_value calculation, can a malicious authority front-run vault operations with run() to set favorable configs (high max_variance), manipulate prices, then restore configs after exploitation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Health Limiter Bypass] If Navi Health Limiter uses this aggregator for health factor calculation and authority reduces max_staleness_seconds to 1, can it cause health checks to fail with stale price errors, bypassing the limiter and allowing unsafe borrows? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Loss Tolerance Abuse] Can an attacker: 1) manipulate aggregator configs to show inflated asset values, 2) trigger vault operation that checks loss_tolerance against the inflated baseline, 3) cause actual loss to be hidden because percentage calculation uses manipulated total_usd_value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Decimal Precision] If Volo Vault expects oracle prices in specific decimals (1e9 or 1e18) but run() sets configs for a feed with different decimal precision, can this cause incorrect asset valuation in vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Permanent DoS] Can a malicious or compromised authority permanently brick the aggregator by setting impossible config combinations (min_sample_size=100, min_responses=1000, max_staleness_seconds=1) that can never be satisfied? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Config Spam] Can an attacker repeatedly call run() with slightly different configs, emitting many AggregatorConfigsUpdated events and consuming gas, either to DoS the network or censor other transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Loss] If authority loses their private key and has_authority check at line 42 always fails, is there any recovery mechanism, or is the aggregator permanently locked with current (potentially vulnerable) configs? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Front-Running DoS] Can an attacker monitor mempool for run() transactions from legitimate authority and front-run with their own config changes, forcing authority to constantly compete on gas or timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Zero Vector] What happens if feed_hash is a valid 32-byte vector but contains all zeros? Line 45 checks length but not content - does this point to an invalid feed causing oracle update failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Minimum Values] If all parameters are set to their minimum valid values (min_sample_size=1, max_variance=1, min_responses=1, max_staleness_seconds=1), does the aggregator become so restrictive that it never produces valid results? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Maximum Values] If all parameters are set to near-maximum values (min_sample_size=MAX_U64-1, max_variance=MAX_U64-1, etc.), do arithmetic operations in compute_current_result overflow or cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Config Overwrite] If multiple config updates happen in rapid succession, can earlier configs be partially applied while later configs overwrite them, creating an inconsistent aggregator state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Empty Results] If the aggregator has no oracle results yet (update_state.results is empty) and run() sets configs, can this cause issues when first add_result() is called with the new configs? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Hash Format] Line 45 checks feed_hash.length() == 32 but doesn't validate hash format (e.g., must be SHA256 or Keccak256) - can an attacker set arbitrary 32 bytes that don't correspond to any valid hash algorithm output? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Feed Identifier] Is feed_hash used as a unique identifier in the oracle queue system? If two aggregators have the same feed_hash, can config updates to one affect the other's oracle data routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Hash Uniqueness] Can an attacker deliberately find or brute-force a feed_hash collision with a legitimate feed to cause oracle updates intended for feed A to be routed to malicious feed B? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Module Boundary] Since set_configs at line 58 is public(package), can other modules in the switchboard package call it directly bypassing validate(), allowing unauthorized config updates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Version Sync] If Aggregator module's VERSION constant changes from 1 to 2 but EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION stays at 1, does this create a permanent incompatibility where new aggregators can never have their configs updated? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [State Read] Does has_authority() at line 42 read a cached authority value, or does it always read the latest aggregator.authority? If cached, can authority changes not be reflected immediately? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Config Atomicity] Are all five config fields (feed_hash, min_sample_size, max_staleness_seconds, max_variance, min_responses) updated atomically in set_configs, or can a transaction abort mid-update leaving some fields changed? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Logic Inconsistency] If min_responses (minimum job successes) is 10 but min_sample_size (minimum valid updates for result) is 3, can jobs succeed with 10 responses but then only 3 be considered valid due to staleness, creating misleading result validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Constraint Conflict] Can an attacker set min_sample_size=1 and min_responses=100, requiring 100 oracle job responses but only 1 sample for result computation, bypassing the intended multi-oracle security through the sample size loophole? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Validation Gap] Since validate() checks parameters independently without cross-parameter validation, can contradictory configs pass (e.g., min_sample_size > MAX_RESULTS * min_responses) that can never be satisfied? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Oracle Incentive Manipulation] If authority can freely change max_staleness_seconds, can they reduce it to reject all current oracle updates, forcing oracles to re-submit (paying gas), then restore the old value, griefing oracles economically? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_set_configs_action.move] [Function: run()] [Gas Griefing] Can an authority account controlled by an attacker repeatedly toggle configs between extreme values (min_sample_size 1 to MAX_U64), consuming gas and making the aggregator unusable due to constant reconfigurations?
