  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Precision Loss] Can an attacker exploit precision loss when converting from high decimal (e.g., 18) to low decimal (e.g., 6), causing value=999999999999999999 to become 999999999999, losing 999999 units worth of value in oracle price feeds used for vault share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Infinite Loop DoS] Can decimal and target_decimal be set to values that cause the while loop to never terminate when value=0 is checked after the condition, allowing an attacker to DoS oracle price conversions by passing initial non-zero value that becomes zero during iteration? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Integer Overflow] When converting from decimal=9 to target_decimal=255, can the repeated multiplication by 10 (246 times) cause value to overflow u256 max before the loop terminates, breaking oracle price feeds for assets with extreme decimal configurations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Zero Value Bypass] Can an attacker pass value=0 with mismatched decimals to bypass all conversion logic and return 0, then use this in vault operations to claim assets are worthless when they have actual value? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Underflow to Zero] When converting large decimals to small decimals with small initial values (e.g., value=5, decimal=18, target_decimal=9), can repeated division by 10 round down to 0 prematurely, causing oracle to report zero price for valuable assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Rounding Direction Manipulation] Does the division by 10 always round down, allowing an attacker to systematically undervalue assets by choosing decimal conversions that maximize rounding losses across multiple price updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Loop Manipulation] Can an attacker pass decimal=u64::MAX and target_decimal=0 to cause the loop to iterate u64::MAX times, creating a DoS condition that blocks all oracle price updates and vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Precision Loss Accumulation] When vault performs multiple sequential decimal conversions (e.g., ETH price 18→9→6→9), can accumulated rounding errors compound to create significant value discrepancies enabling arbitrage or theft? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Early Loop Termination] If value becomes 0 during conversion but decimal!=target_decimal, does the function return 0 immediately, potentially causing oracle to report zero prices when assets should have non-zero values after full conversion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Maximum Value Overflow] When value approaches u256::MAX and decimal < target_decimal, can the multiplication by 10 overflow silently in Move, wrapping around to small values and causing oracle to report drastically incorrect prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker force expensive oracle updates by passing decimal=0 and target_decimal=255, requiring 255 loop iterations of multiplication, causing legitimate users to pay excessive gas or hitting block gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Inconsistent Decimal Handling] If callers incorrectly assume this function validates decimal ranges (e.g., decimal > target_decimal by 50+ units), can invalid conversions propagate through vault USD value calculations causing share price manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Stack Overflow Prevention Bypass] The comment mentions 'zero check to prevent stack overflow', but can an attacker pass value=1 with extreme decimal differences (e.g., 0→255) to still cause stack overflow despite the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value_safe()] [Decimal Confusion Attack] Can an attacker exploit the fact this function uses u64 for decimals while to_target_decimal_value() uses u8, causing type confusion when callers mix the two functions in oracle price processing?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Type Mismatch Exploit] The function uses u8 for decimals while to_target_decimal_value_safe() uses u64, can an attacker exploit different overflow boundaries (u8::MAX=255 vs u64::MAX) to cause inconsistent price conversions across vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Overflow Without Check] Unlike the safe version, this function has no overflow protection when multiplying value by 10 repeatedly, can value * 10^(target_decimal - decimal) exceed u256::MAX causing silent wrapping and catastrophic price miscalculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Infinite Loop Risk] The while loop has no maximum iteration limit, can an attacker pass decimal=255 and target_decimal=0 to force 255 iterations, causing oracle price updates to consume excessive gas and potentially hit execution limits?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [No Zero Value Check] Unlike to_target_decimal_value_safe(), this function doesn't check if value becomes 0 during conversion, can this cause unnecessary iterations and gas waste when processing oracle prices for very small amounts?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Assertion Error Code Weak] The assertion uses error code 1 which is generic, can this make debugging oracle price conversion failures difficult, potentially hiding systematic exploitation in production?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Missing Upper Bound Check] While asserting decimals > 0, there's no check that decimals <= 16 (the default limit), can passing decimal=255 cause excessive iterations and DoS oracle price calculation for vault operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_utils.move] [Function: to_target_decimal_value()] [Function Selection Attack] Can an attacker exploit contracts that use both safe and unsafe versions inconsistently, causing some price feeds to abort on edge cases while others return incorrect values, creating arbitrage opportunities?
