  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Bounds] There's no validation on rate bounds - can admin set rate to extreme values causing calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Update Frequency] If rate can be updated frequently, can admin manipulate rate updates to exploit reward calculation timing? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Rate Units] What are the units of rate - per second, per epoch? Can unit confusion cause massive over/under rewards? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [u64 to u256 Cast] Duration is cast from u64 to u256 at line 88 - can this introduce any unexpected behavior at boundaries? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [u256 Maximum] Can any calculation in this function produce u256::MAX causing overflow in subsequent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Vector Element Type] Vector elements are u256 for rewards (line 53) - can maximum u256 values cause issues in claiming logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_global_index()] [Default Global Index] If global_index starts at zero, the first calculation will be all from index_increased - is this expected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: calculate_user_reward()] [User Index Initialization] If user_index is zero for new users, they get full historical rewards - is this intended or exploitable? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Empty Initialization] All return vectors start empty (lines 15-19) - can there be issues if function aborts before any elements are added? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Asset Pool Isolation] Each asset has separate pool - can rewards from one asset pool affect another pool through shared storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_ui/sources/incentive_v3.move] [Function: get_user_atomic_claimable_rewards()] [Rule ID Collisions] Can different assets have rules with same rule_id causing confusion in rule_ids return vector (line 52)? (High)"
