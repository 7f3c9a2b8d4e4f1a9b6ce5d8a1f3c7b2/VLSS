  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [First-Come First-Served] The registry uses a first-come first-served model. Could this enable attackers to pre-register markets for all types that Volo Vault plans to support? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Health Check] The registry doesn't verify that registered markets are properly initialized or have reasonable parameters. Could Volo Vault adaptors interact with broken markets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Cross-Protocol Phishing] Could an attacker register markets with type parameters that mimic legitimate Volo Vault assets but redirect to malicious contracts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Checksums] The registry stores IDs without any checksums or verification data. Could bit-flip errors in storage cause incorrect ID lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Auditing] The registry doesn't log market creation details. Could this make post-exploit forensics difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Struct: Registry] [No Versioning Per Entry] Individual table entries aren't versioned. Could this make it impossible to track which version of the code created each market? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [OwnerCap Security] The LendingMarketOwnerCap is returned directly to the caller. Could the caller be a malicious contract that immediately misuses it? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [No Cap Validation] There's no validation of the OwnerCap properties. Could malformed caps with incorrect lending_market_id fields be returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Function: create_lending_market()] [Cap Loss Risk] If the caller loses the OwnerCap, the market becomes unmanageable. Is there a recovery mechanism? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Module: lending_market_registry] [No Access Control] The module has no friend declarations or package-level access restrictions. Could this allow unexpected cross-module interactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Module: lending_market_registry] [Module Visibility] All functions and types have appropriate visibility, but could future additions accidentally expose internal state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/lending_market_registry.move] [Module: lending_market_registry] [Dependency Chain] The module depends on std::type_name, sui::table, and suilend::lending_market. Could vulnerabilities in these dependencies be exploited through the registry? (Medium)"
