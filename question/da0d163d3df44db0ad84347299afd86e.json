  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Reserve Factor Manipulation] At line 365, reserve_factor is fetched and used at line 370. Can manipulating reserve_factor allow extracting more fees than intended? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Underflow Risk] At line 370, (ray() - reserve_factor) can underflow if reserve_factor > ray(). Can this wrap to max value causing inflated supply rates? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Utilization Manipulation] The function uses dynamic_caculate_utilization at line 366. Can the same utilization manipulation attacks that affect borrow rate also affect supply rate? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Ray Math Chain] The function chains three ray_mul operations at lines 368-371. Can precision loss accumulate significantly across these operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Borrow Rate Dependency] The function uses borrow_rate parameter passed in. Can an attacker provide incorrect borrow_rate to manipulate supply_rate? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/dynamic_calculator.move] [Function: dynamic_calculate_supply_rate()] [Zero Utilization] If utilization is 0, the entire calculation at lines 368-371 returns 0 supply rate. Is this intended behavior or can it be exploited? (Low)"
