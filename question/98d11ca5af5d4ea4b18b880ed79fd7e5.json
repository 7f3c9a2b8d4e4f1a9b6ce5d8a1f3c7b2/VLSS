  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the lack of pool ownership verification to create flash loan assets for pools they don't control, potentially enabling unauthorized fee extraction or asset manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Access Control] Does StorageAdminCap grant global admin rights across all pools, allowing a single compromised admin to misconfigure flash loans for all assets and drain fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Authorization] Can repeated calls to rate setter functions with StorageAdminCap bypass any rate-of-change limits or cooldown periods in the underlying flash_loan module? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Authorization] If StorageAdminCap is compromised, can attacker set treasury rate to 100% to siphon all flash loan fees away from suppliers? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Type Confusion] Can attacker pass mismatched generic type T and asset_id to bypass the type_name equality check at line 38, creating flash loan config for wrong asset type? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Input Validation] What prevents asset_id from being reused to create duplicate flash loan assets, potentially causing state corruption or double-fee collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Boundary Check] If reserves_count equals asset_id (line 35), the check `asset_id < reserves_count` fails, but what if reserves_count is 0 - does this create an invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Integer Overflow] Can rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury exceed u64::MAX causing overflow in fee calculations within flash_loan::create_asset? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Logic Error] What prevents maximum parameter from being less than minimum, creating impossible flash loan constraints that DoS the lending pool? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: create_flash_loan_asset()] [Rate Validation] Can rates be set to 0 allowing free flash loans, or to extreme values (near u64::MAX) causing integer overflow in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Front-running] Can admin front-run large flash loan transactions by updating rates immediately before execution to extract maximum fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_treasury()] [Economic Attack] Can malicious admin set treasury rate to 100% and supplier rate to 0, making flash loans unprofitable and causing DoS through liquidity withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_rate_to_supplier()] [Type Mismatch] Does the function validate that type T exists in the flash loan config before updating, or can it create invalid entries for non-existent assets? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_min()] [DoS Attack] Can admin set minimum to u64::MAX to completely disable flash loans, locking legitimate users out? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_max()] [Constraint Violation] If max is set below current outstanding flash loans, does this create an inconsistent state preventing loan repayment? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_min()] [Configuration Error] Can min be set higher than existing max value, creating impossible flash loan conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: set_flash_loan_asset_max()] [Integer Underflow] If max is set to 0, can this cause underflow when calculating available flash loan capacity? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: deposit_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Amount Validation] Can attacker pass amount=0 to deposit nothing but trigger state changes, potentially manipulating reward distribution timing? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: deposit_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Input Validation] What prevents amount from exceeding coin::value, given the assertion at line 106 allows equality - can this be exploited if coin value is manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: deposit_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Self Transfer] Line 111 transfers remaining deposit_coin back to sender - if sender is a malicious contract, can re-entrancy occur before transfer completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: deposit_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Precision Loss] When splitting coin at line 107, if amount is very small relative to total coin value, can dust amounts accumulate causing accounting errors? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Authorization] Can StorageAdminCap holder withdraw reward funds intended for users, effectively stealing deposited incentive rewards? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_incentive_v3_reward_fund()] [Input Validation] What prevents amount from exceeding reward fund balance, causing the underlying incentive_v3::withdraw_reward_fund to fail or underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Fund Theft] Can StorageAdminCap holder arbitrarily withdraw borrow fees to any recipient address, bypassing intended fee distribution logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/manage.move] [Function: withdraw_borrow_fee()] [Amount Validation] Is there validation that amount doesn't exceed accumulated borrow fees, or can this drain other pooled funds? (High)"
