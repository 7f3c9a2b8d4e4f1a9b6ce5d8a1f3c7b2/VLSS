  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Missing Validation] [No Transfer Restrictions] 'store' ability allows unrestricted transfer - should certain caps be non-transferable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Business Logic] [Single Owner Model] Each cap has single owner - does this prevent multi-sig or DAO-controlled lending positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Business Logic] [Parent-Child Purpose] Why do child caps exist if they have same owner as parent? What's the business logic preventing exploits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Business Logic] [Ownership Transfer] If AccountCap is transferred, should lending positions transfer too or stay with original owner? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Business Logic] [Cap Recovery] If user loses AccountCap, is there recovery mechanism? Or are positions permanently locked? (High)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Sui-Specific] [Object Ownership] AccountCap has 'key' so it's an object - if it's owned vs shared, how does this affect lending operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Sui-Specific] [UID to Address] Uses object::uid_to_address - is this cryptographically secure? Can attacker find UID that maps to victim's address? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/account.move] [Sui-Specific] [Dynamic Fields] AccountCap can have dynamic fields via 'store' - can attacker add malicious fields to corrupt cap? (High)",
