  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: is_oracle_price_fresh()] [Configuration] If max_timestamp_diff = 1, only prices from the exact same timestamp pass. Can this cause all practical oracle updates to fail due to timestamp granularity? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [State Consistency] If ratio2_usage_start_time is updated between calls, can this cause inconsistent severity levels for the same price pair, allowing an attacker to cherry-pick favorable outcomes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_range_and_history()] [State Consistency] If historical_price and historical_updated_time are updated separately (not atomically), can a race condition cause validation against mismatched historical data?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_range_and_history()] [State Consistency] If minimum_effective_price and maximum_effective_price are updated separately, can a temporary state where minimum > maximum cause all prices to be rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [Zero Value] If primary_price = 0 and secondary_price = 0, calculate_amplitude returns U64MAX. Does this correctly handle the case where both oracles report zero? (Medium)",

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/strategy.move] [Function: validate_price_difference()] [Return Value] The function can return 4 different u8 values (0, 1, 2, 3).
