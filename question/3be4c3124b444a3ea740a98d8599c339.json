  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_max()] [Max Decrease Attack] If admin decreases max below active flash loan amounts, can in-flight flash loans with amount > new max fail to repay due to validation mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: set_asset_min()] [Min Increase Attack] If admin increases min above active flash loan amounts, can this orphan existing loans that can't be repaid because they don't meet new minimum? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Withdrawal Failure] Line 155 calls pool::withdraw_balance(_pool, _loan_amount, _user) - if pool has insufficient balance, can this cause abort without cleaning up receipt, leaving dangling receipt state? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Split Error Handling] Line 196 calls balance::split which can abort if insufficient balance - can this be exploited to leave receipt consumed but repayment incomplete, stealing flash loan funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Deposit Failure] Line 197 calls pool::deposit_balance with repay balance - if deposit fails after split, can funds be lost in transaction limbo between split and deposit? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Treasury Deposit Ordering] Line 198 deposits treasury fees after main deposit at line 197 - can pool state changes between these calls cause treasury deposit to fail while main deposit succeeds? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Remaining Balance] Line 208 returns _repay_balance after splits - can caller drain remaining balance without penalty, effectively getting free flash loan on the excess? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Balance Type Safety] Line 155 returns Balance<CoinType> - can type parameter mismatch between loan and repay allow attacker to repay with wrong coin type? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [State Update Timing] Line 182 calls logic::update_state_of_all before computing scaled fees - can stale state cause incorrect supply index to be used for fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Index Retrieval] Line 186 calls storage::get_index(storage, asset_id) - can asset_id mismatch between loan and repay cause index to be fetched for wrong asset? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Cumulate to Supply] Line 189 calls logic::cumulate_to_supply_index(storage, asset_id, scaled_fee_to_supplier) - can scaled_fee_to_supplier be manipulated to inflate supply index and drain protocol reserves? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Interest Rate Update] Line 190 calls logic::update_interest_rate after cumulating fees - can this cause interest rate to spike based on fee amounts, griefing normal borrowers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Asset ID Mismatch] Line 183 derives asset_id from type name but line 189 uses it to update storage - can type name collision cause fees to be credited to wrong asset's suppliers? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Ray Math Precision] Line 187 uses ray_math::ray_div for scaled fee calculation - can precision loss in ray division cause accumulated fees to drift from actual fees collected? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Normal Amount Conversion] Line 185 calls pool::normal_amount with fee_to_supplier - if this conversion uses different rounding than loan fee calculation, can attacker profit from rounding differences? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Event Spoofing] Lines 166-170 emit FlashLoan event with sender = _user passed as parameter - can friend module pass arbitrary _user address to emit fake flash loan events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Event Data Mismatch] Lines 200-206 emit FlashRepay event using receipt fields - if receipt was manipulated, can event data misrepresent actual repay amounts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_config()] [Event Timing] Line 97 emits ConfigCreated before share_object at line 99 - can transaction revert after event emission but before sharing, creating false config creation events? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: create_asset()] [Event Asset ID] Lines 133-137 emit AssetConfigCreated with new_obj_address - can attacker monitor events to front-run asset config creation and register malicious pool first? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Reentrancy] Loan at line 155 withdraws balance before receipt is marked used, then repay at line 197 deposits before updating state - can attacker reenter between loan and repay to take nested flash loans? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Oracle Manipulation] Flash loan provides instant liquidity - can attacker use loaned funds to manipulate oracle prices referenced by storage::get_index before repay? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: repay()] [Governance Attack] Attacker uses flash loan to acquire governance tokens and vote on malicious proposals within same transaction - can repay logic be exploited to extend voting power beyond single transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan() + repay()] [Cross-Pool Arbitrage] Attacker takes flash loan from pool A, manipulates pool B's state, repays to pool A - can receipt validation be bypassed to repay to different pool than loaned from? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Liquidity Drain] Multiple attackers coordinate to take max flash loans from all pools simultaneously - can this cause system-wide liquidity crisis where no pool has funds for withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/flash_loan.move] [Function: loan()] [Generic Type Confusion] CoinType is phantom type parameter in Receipt - can attacker create Receipt<WrongCoin> and repay with different coin type to steal funds? (Critical)"
