  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Visibility] validate() is public - can external contracts call it to test authority without committing to deletion, leaking authorization info? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Visibility] actuate() has default visibility - should it be public(package) or private to prevent misuse by external callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Entry Function] run() being a public entry function exposes direct transaction calls - should it require additional module-level authorization? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Vault Integration] If Volo Vault's health_limiter depends on this aggregator for Navi health factor checks, can deletion bypass health checks and enable unsafe borrows? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Loss Tolerance] Can aggregator deletion during a vault epoch cause the loss_tolerance check to fail incorrectly, preventing legitimate withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Adaptor Impact] Do vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus, Momentum) have fallback logic if their oracle aggregator is deleted, or will operations revert indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Operation Status] Should validate() check if the vault is in 'during_operation' status and prevent aggregator deletion until operations complete? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Oracle Config] If vault oracle_config stores references to this aggregator ID, can deletion leave dangling references that cause vault initialization failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Migration Path] If aggregators need to be migrated from v1 to v2, can version mismatch at line 18 brick the migration by preventing old aggregator deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Constant: EXPECTED_AGGREGATOR_VERSION] [Upgrade Safety] Should version checking use >= instead of == to allow deletion of future versions, or does strict equality protect against unknown version behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Empty Aggregator] Can an aggregator with zero updates (empty UpdateState.results vector) be safely deleted, or should there be minimum usage requirements? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Max Updates] If an aggregator has MAX_RESULTS (16) updates stored, does deletion properly clean up all vector elements without gas exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Concurrent Deletion] If two transactions attempt to delete the same aggregator simultaneously, does one gracefully fail or can both succeed with double event emission? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Authority Rotation] If authority is transferred via aggregator_set_authority_action between validate() and actuate(), can the old authority complete deletion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: run()] [Module Upgrade] If this action module is upgraded but aggregator.move is not, can version mismatches prevent any aggregator deletion permanently? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: actuate()] [Event Indexing] Can the AggregatorDeleted event be spoofed by emitting it without actual deletion if event::emit() is callable from other contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/aggregator/aggregator_delete_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Shared Object] If aggregator is shared and has pending transactions, can validate() pass but actuate() fail due to object locks? (Medium)"
