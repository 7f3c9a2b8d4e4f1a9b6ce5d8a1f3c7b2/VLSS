  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: ray_mul()] [Type Confusion] Can wad values be mistakenly passed to ray_mul, causing results to be off by a factor of 1e9 in share calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: Multiple] [Unit Confusion] If vault code mixes raw u256 values, wad, and ray without proper conversions, can this cause catastrophic calculation errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Constants] [Upgrade Safety] If WAD or RAY constants are changed in a protocol upgrade, would existing vault positions become corrupted due to precision changes? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_to_ray()] [Migration] During migration from volo_v1, if old code used different wad/ray definitions, can conversion via wad_to_ray corrupt migrated balances? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: Multiple] [Version Compatibility] Are ray_math functions compatible across different versions of the protocol, or could version mismatches cause calculation inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_mul()] [Distributivity] Does wad_mul maintain distributivity (a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c), or do rounding errors break this property enabling arbitrage? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_div() + wad_mul()] [Inverse Operation] Is wad_div the exact inverse of wad_mul (wad_div(wad_mul(a, b), b) = a), or does rounding prevent this equality? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: ray_mul() + ray_div()] [Inverse Operation] For ray operations, is ray_div(ray_mul(a, b), b) always equal to a, or can rounding cause drift enabling value extraction? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_mul()] [Monotonicity] Is wad_mul monotonic (if a1 < a2, then wad_mul(a1, b) < wad_mul(a2, b)), or can rounding violate monotonicity in edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_div()] [Monotonicity] Is wad_div monotonic in its first argument, and can violation of monotonicity be exploited in vault ordering logic? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: ray_to_wad()] [Price Feed] If Switchboard oracle returns prices in ray but vault expects wad, can ray_to_wad precision loss cause systematic undervaluation of assets? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: wad_to_ray()] [Price Comparison] When comparing wad-denominated vault prices to ray-denominated external prices, can conversion errors trigger incorrect health factor calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/math/sources/ray_math.move] [Function: ray_to_wad()] [Oracle Staleness] If stale oracle prices in ray are converted to wad, can precision loss hide that prices haven't updated, bypassing staleness checks? (Medium)"
