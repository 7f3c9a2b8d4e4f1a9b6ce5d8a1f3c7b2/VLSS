  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the pause check by manipulating the oracle_config object before calling this function, allowing price fetches during emergency pauses when the protocol should be frozen? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Version Control] If version_verification fails but doesn't abort, can stale oracle logic be executed with incompatible config structures, leading to incorrect price data being used in vault value calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Pause Mechanism] Can the pause flag be toggled mid-execution in a concurrent transaction, allowing price fetches to complete even after pause is activated, potentially using stale prices during emergency situations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Access Control] Since this is a public function without capability checks, can external malicious contracts call it with manipulated oracle objects to retrieve incorrect prices for their own exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Price Feed Validation] Can an attacker provide a feed_address that points to a disabled or malicious price feed that was previously enabled, bypassing the is_price_feed_enable check through race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Error Handling] When price_feed_not_found error is returned with price 0, can calling contracts misinterpret this as a valid zero price, leading to incorrect vault valuations or free withdrawals? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Feed Address Validation] Can an attacker register a malicious feed_address with crafted oracle_id that returns manipulated decimals, causing price calculation overflow/underflow in downstream vault operations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Configuration Integrity] If get_price_feed returns a partially initialized or corrupted price_feed object, can subsequent config getters return default/zero values that compromise price validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the Clock object passed as a parameter to artificially advance current_timestamp, making stale prices appear fresh and bypassing staleness checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Max Timestamp Diff] If max_timestamp_diff is set to an extremely large value (e.g., u64::MAX), can arbitrarily old prices be considered fresh, allowing exploitation using historical price data during market volatility? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Timestamp Overflow] Can timestamp arithmetic in is_oracle_price_fresh cause overflow when current_timestamp - primary_updated_time wraps around, incorrectly marking stale prices as fresh? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Clock Manipulation] If the Sui Clock object is compromised or manipulated by validators, can systematic timestamp errors allow stale price acceptance across all vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Staleness Window] Can an attacker time their transactions to arrive just before max_timestamp_diff expires, ensuring they can use the oldest acceptable price for maximum exploitation in arbitrage scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Decimal Precision] If safe_decimal returns incorrect decimal values due to oracle_id mismatch, can price calculations overflow or underflow when converting between different decimal precisions (1e9 vs 1e18)? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Decimal Consistency] Can inconsistent decimal values between primary and secondary oracle providers cause the price difference validation to incorrectly compare prices at different scales, bypassing diff thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Decimal Overflow] When oracle_pro::get_price_from_adaptor applies decimal normalization, can extremely large or small prices cause u256 overflow/underflow, resulting in price wrapping to zero or max values? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Decimal Zero] If safe_decimal returns 0 due to missing oracle configuration, can division by zero occur in downstream price calculations when normalizing values? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Empty Provider] When primary_oracle_provider is empty, the function returns error code but with price 0 - can this be exploited in contracts that don't properly check error codes, treating 0 as a valid price? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Provider Disabled] If primary_oracle_provider_config is disabled mid-flight after the check, can get_price_from_adaptor still execute with stale/invalid configuration data? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Provider Validation] Can an attacker register a malicious primary oracle provider that always returns favorable prices (e.g., inflated for withdrawals, deflated for deposits), exploiting vault operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Adaptor Exploit] Can oracle_pro::get_price_from_adaptor be manipulated by passing crafted supra_oracle_holder or pyth_price_info objects that return attacker-controlled prices? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Provider Swap] If the primary provider is swapped to a different oracle type (Supra to Pyth) without updating adaptor logic, can type mismatches cause crashes or return default zero prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Secondary Availability] If is_secondary_oracle_available returns true but secondary_source_config is malformed, can get_price_from_adaptor fail silently, leaving secondary_price as 0 and bypassing validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Secondary Fallback] When primary price is stale but secondary is fresh, the function switches to secondary_price - can this be exploited by manipulating only the secondary oracle while ensuring primary goes stale? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_dynamic_getter.move] [Function: get_dynamic_single_price()] [Initialization State] Since secondary_price and secondary_updated_time are initialized to 0, can edge cases where secondary oracle fails leave these as 0, incorrectly triggering fallback logic? (Medium)"
