  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: export_stakes_from_v1()] [Skip Logic] When validator not in vaults (line 323), loop continues but doesn't account for this in iteration limit; can validators be unfairly starved of export iterations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Constant: MIST_PER_SUI] [Magic Number] If MIST_PER_SUI (line 22) is not precisely 1_000_000_000, can rounding in split logic (line 238-240) cause 1-SUI discrepancies in accounting? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Constant: MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE] [DoS Attack] MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE = 16 (line 23) limits batch updates, but can an attacker perform 15 malicious updates per transaction repeatedly, degrading protocol performance? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Bounds Check] Assert length < MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE (line 154) uses strict inequality; should it be <=, allowing exactly 16 updates, or is off-by-one intentional? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: update_validators()] [Bounds Check] Post-update assertion vec_map::size(&self.validators) < MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE (line 171) can fail if validators were added via another path; should this use <= to allow exactly MAX_VLDRS_UPDATE? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Error: E_NO_ACTIVE_VLDRS] [Edge Case] If all validators have priority 0, is sorted_validators non-empty but effectively useless, causing E_NO_ACTIVE_VLDRS on get_top_validator() despite validators existing? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Error: E_BAD_ARGS] [Input Validation] E_BAD_ARGS only checks length mismatch (line 155); should it also validate that addresses are unique and priorities are within reasonable bounds? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Error: E_BAD_CONDITION] [Assertion] E_BAD_CONDITION at line 262 asserts total_staked == 0; if this fails, is the error message sufficiently descriptive for debugging accounting bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Error: E_NOT_FOUND] [Edge Case] E_NOT_FOUND at line 272 fires if validator not in sorted_validators; can legitimate race conditions (concurrent updates) trigger this, causing unexpected abort? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Error: E_TOO_MANY_VLDRS] [Bounds Check] E_TOO_MANY_VLDRS at lines 154 and 171 uses different contexts; can the first check pass but second fail, leaving is_sorted = false without completing update? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: get_total_stake()] [Edge Case] When validator not in vaults (line 105), function returns 0; can this mask errors where validator exists in validators vec_map but vault is missing? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: ValidatorSet] [Key Ability] ValidatorSet has key + store abilities; can it be wrapped in another object to bypass package-level access controls on its methods? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Struct: Vault] [Store Ability] Vault has only store ability without key; can vaults be extracted from Table and stored elsewhere, breaking validator association? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: is_sorted] [State Flag] is_sorted flag (line 57) is set to false on updates but never validated before reads; can operations proceed on unsorted data, causing incorrect validator selection? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: sorted_validators] [Stale Data] sorted_validators vector may be stale if is_sorted is false; should reads of sorted_validators enforce is_sorted == true or auto-trigger sorting? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: gap] [Accounting] gap field tracks removed stakes, but if gap > u32::MAX, can casting or arithmetic overflow in index calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: length] [Overflow] length field increments on add_stake(); can u64 overflow if billions of stakes are added, corrupting vault state? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Field: total_staked] [Precision] total_staked is u64 in MIST; if stakes have sub-MIST precision from staking rewards, can rounding errors accumulate? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: test_create()] [Test Exposure] test_create() creates and shares ValidatorSet; if test_only is not properly gated, can this be called in production, creating rogue ValidatorSet objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: add_stake_for_testing()] [Test Exposure] add_stake_for_testing() is public with test_only; if compilation flags are misconfigured, can this bypass package visibility in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: remove_stakes_for_testing()] [Test Exposure] remove_stakes_for_testing() exposes remove_stakes() publicly for testing; can this be exploited if test_only attribute is removed or misconfigured? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Function: test_update_and_sort()] [Test Exposure] test_update_and_sort() provides unrestricted update + sort access; if test_only fails, can attackers manipulate validator priorities arbitrarily? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Event: ValidatorsSorted] [Information Disclosure] ValidatorsSorted event emits entire sorted_validators vector; can this leak validator strategy to front-runners who optimize their stake timing? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Event: ValidatorPriorUpdated] [DoS] ValidatorPriorUpdated emitted on every update (line 180); can batch updates cause event log spam, degrading indexer performance? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/validator_set.move] [Event: ValidatorsSorted] [Frequency] sort_validators() emits event every time (line 144); if called frequently, can this create excessive on-chain event data? (Low)"
