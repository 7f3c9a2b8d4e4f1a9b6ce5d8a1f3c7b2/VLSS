(Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a timestamp_seconds value close to u64::MAX such that timestamp_seconds * 1000 + ATTESTATION_VALIDITY_MS wraps around to a small value, passing the check at line 73 even with very old attestations? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Stale Attestation] Can an attacker use attestations that are exactly ATTESTATION_VALIDITY_MS (10 hours) old, potentially allowing reuse of compromised keys that have since been rotated? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Edge Case] What happens when clock.timestamp_ms() is 0 or very small and timestamp_seconds * 1000 + ATTESTATION_VALIDITY_MS is checked - can this create an edge case allowing invalid attestations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/oracle/oracle_attest_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Precision Loss] Does the conversion from timestamp_seconds to milliseconds (multiply by 1000) at line 73 create any precision loss scenarios that could be exploited?
