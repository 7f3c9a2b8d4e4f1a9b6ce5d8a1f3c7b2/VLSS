  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: paused()] [Authorization Bypass] If calling code fails to check paused() error (1500) before critical operations like deposits/borrows, can an attacker perform operations during protocol pause, violating the pause invariant and enabling unauthorized fund movements? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: not_owner()] [Authorization Bypass] If caller verification using not_owner() error (1501) is missing or incorrectly implemented in admin functions, can unauthorized users execute privileged operations like reserve configuration or fee updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: user_is_unhealthy()] [Health Check Bypass] If user_is_unhealthy() error (1600) is not enforced before allowing withdrawals/borrows, can users extract collateral while insolvent, creating bad debt for the protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_price()] [Oracle Manipulation] If invalid_price() error (1502) validation is insufficient (e.g., not checking staleness, bounds, or zero values), can stale or manipulated oracle prices enable over-borrowing or under-collateralized liquidations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: ltv_is_not_enough()] [Accounting Error] If ltv_is_not_enough() check (1603) uses incorrect decimals or outdated prices, can users borrow beyond safe LTV ratios, creating systemic insolvency risk? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: exceeded_maximum_deposit_cap()] [Cap Enforcement] If exceeded_maximum_deposit_cap() error (1604) is not checked atomically with deposits, can race conditions allow total deposits to exceed the configured cap, violating protocol limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: exceeded_maximum_borrow_cap()] [Cap Enforcement] If exceeded_maximum_borrow_cap() error (1605) check is performed before other state changes, can attackers exploit reentrancy or race conditions to borrow beyond protocol limits? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: user_is_healthy()] [Liquidation Denial] If user_is_healthy() error (1606) prevents liquidations of healthy users but is checked with stale prices, can liquidators be blocked from liquidating actually-unhealthy positions, causing bad debt accumulation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: insufficient_balance()] [Balance Check] If insufficient_balance() error (1506) is not validated before transfer operations, can users withdraw more than their actual balance, draining protocol reserves? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_amount()] [Input Validation] If invalid_amount() error (1503) allows zero or MAX_U64 amounts to pass validation, can these edge values cause overflow/underflow in subsequent calculations, corrupting accounting? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: reserve_not_found()] [Missing Reserve Check] If reserve_not_found() error (2000) is not checked before reserve operations, can operations proceed on non-existent reserves, causing panics or state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: duplicate_reserve()] [Reserve Management] If duplicate_reserve() error (1701) is not enforced during reserve creation, can multiple reserves with the same coin type be created, causing accounting confusion and fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_pool()] [Pool Validation] If invalid_pool() error (1504) is not checked when operations reference pool IDs, can cross-pool contamination occur, mixing assets between isolated pools? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_coin_type()] [Type Safety] If invalid_coin_type() error (1505) allows mismatched coin types in operations, can attackers deposit one asset but receive shares valued as another, exploiting price differentials? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: user_have_no_collateral()] [Collateral Check] If user_have_no_collateral() error (1601) is not enforced before allowing borrows, can users borrow without posting collateral, creating immediate bad debt? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: user_have_no_loan()] [Loan Check] If user_have_no_loan() error (1602) is not checked before repayment operations, can users trigger state inconsistencies by repaying non-existent loans, corrupting accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: no_more_reserves_allowed()] [Reserve Limit] If no_more_reserves_allowed() error (1700) limit is not enforced, can unlimited reserves be added, causing gas exhaustion in iteration-based operations or exceeding storage limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: incorrect_version()] [Version Check] If incorrect_version() error (1400) is not validated during upgrades or migrations, can incompatible contract versions interact, causing state corruption or fund loss? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: not_available_version()] [Version Availability] If not_available_version() error (1401) allows operations on deprecated versions, can users exploit known vulnerabilities in old code paths? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: invalid_value()] [Value Validation] If invalid_value() error (1507) does not validate calculated values for overflow/underflow, can extreme values corrupt share prices or interest calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/lending_core/sources/error.move] [Function: non_single_value()] [Value Uniqueness] If non_single_value() error (1801) is not enforced where single-value semantics are required, can multiple conflicting values exist, causing non-deterministic behavior?
