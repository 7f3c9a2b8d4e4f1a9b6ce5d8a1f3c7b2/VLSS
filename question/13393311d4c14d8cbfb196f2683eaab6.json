  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Struct: Cell<Element>] [Phantom Types] If Cell is used with phantom type parameters in vault (e.g., Cell<phantom T> for type-level separation), can type parameter manipulation bypass vault's type safety checks for different asset classes? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Lifetime Extension] get() returns &Element with implicit lifetime tied to &Cell. If vault stores this reference in temporary struct that outlives the cell's mutable borrow scope, can this create UAF when cell is modified via set()? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: new()] [Zero Value] If new() is called with zero-value element (e.g., Cell::new(Coin::zero<SUI>())), can subsequent operations assume non-zero invariant and suffer division-by-zero when calculating share prices? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] If multiple Suilend modules (lending_core, reserve, obligation) each use Cell<T> for state management, can cross-module calls create borrow cycles where get() in module A calls module B which calls get() in module A causing deadlock? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Integration] If Cell<LendingMarket> is shared between multiple vault adaptors (Navi, Suilend, Cetus) and each calls get() to read market state while another calls set() to update, can interleaved operations cause race conditions in health factor calculations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [Gas Griefing] If set() is called repeatedly to swap large Element types (e.g., Cell<vector<u8>> with 1MB data), can attacker cause gas exhaustion DoS in vault operations that depend on cell updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: destroy()] [Gas Bomb] If destroy() is called on Cell<LargeStruct> containing nested objects/tables, does gas cost scale linearly with size, and can attacker create expensive-to-destroy cells to DoS vault unwinding operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: get()] [Null Dereference] If external code incorrectly creates Cell with None element through unsafe deserialization, get() will panic on option::borrow. Can this be weaponized to brick critical vault paths like emergency withdrawal where Cell<EmergencyConfig> must be readable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: set()] [Swap Atomicity] set() performs swap in single operation using option::swap. If Element type has complex drop logic (e.g., calling external modules on drop), can side effects during swap cause unexpected state changes in vault accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Module] [Missing Constraints] Cell module doesn't enforce any constraints on Element type abilities (copy, drop, store, key). Can this enable creating problematic cell types like Cell<NonDrop> where destroy() cannot extract element if Element lacks drop, causing permanent lock? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/suilend_d/suilend/sources/cell.move] [Function: new()] [Construction Safety] new() wraps element in Some without validation. If element is constructed via unsafe code path with invalid state (negative balance, expired timestamp), does cell provide any invariant guarantees, or can corrupt cells propagate through vault causing systemic failures? (High)"
