  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [All Setter Functions] [Event Monitoring Bypass] Can an attacker update oracle parameters in a way that events are emitted but monitoring systems can't detect malicious changes due to event data encoding? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Pause Bypass via Provider] If oracle_config is paused, can price queries still succeed by directly accessing enabled providers through other modules? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Partial Pause] Can an attacker pause oracle_config but leave price_oracle unpaused, creating inconsistent pause state where some price paths work and others don't? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_pause()] [Unpause During Attack] If oracle is paused during a price manipulation attack, can an attacker with OracleAdminCap unpause it before the attack is fully mitigated? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_pyth_oracle_provider_config()] [Provider Creation Spam] Can an attacker create numerous provider configs for different feed_ids to exhaust storage or cause configuration lookup performance degradation?

(Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_historical_price_ttl_to_price_feed()] [TTL Manipulation for Fallback] Can an attacker set historical_price_ttl such that stale manipulated prices are used as fallback when live prices are temporarily unavailable? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_max_duration_within_thresholds_to_price_feed()] [Timer Reset Attack] Does changing max_duration_within_thresholds reset the diff_threshold2_timer, allowing an attacker to extend anomaly duration indefinitely by repeatedly updating this value? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Decimal Mismatch] Can an attacker create price feeds with mismatched decimals compared to actual asset decimals, causing 1000x price errors in vault calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Precision Loss] If maximum_effective_price is set without considering decimal precision, can prices that should be valid get rejected due to precision mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: version_migrate()] [Cross-Module Version Skew] If oracle_manage version migrates oracle_config but oracle_pro module still uses old version, can this cause price query failures or bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [All Functions] [Config Module Trust] Since all functions delegate to config module, if config module has vulnerabilities, can attacker exploit them through oracle_manage's admin-gated interface? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: disable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Disable During Price Update] Can an attacker disable Pyth provider while a price update transaction is in-flight, causing partial update or inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: enable_pyth_oracle_provider()] [Enable Unconfigured] Can an attacker enable a provider immediately after creation but before pair_id is properly configured, allowing queries to return null/default prices? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Duplicate CoinType] Can an attacker create multiple feeds for the same CoinType with different oracle_ids, causing price ambiguity where different systems use different feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Zero Values Attack] Can an attacker create price feed with all threshold values set to 0, effectively disabling all price validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: create_price_feed()] [Maximum Values Attack] Can an attacker create price feed with all parameters set to maximum values, causing overflow in price validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold1_to_price_feed()] [Threshold1 Manipulation] Can an attacker set threshold1 to nearly equal threshold2, collapsing the two-tier system and allowing rapid price changes to be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_price_diff_threshold2_to_price_feed()] [Threshold2 Manipulation] Can an attacker set threshold2 far above threshold1, creating a wide acceptance range where manipulated prices remain valid for extended periods? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_allowed_span_percentage_to_price_feed()] [Span Set to 1] Can an attacker set span to 1 basis point (0.01%), causing all legitimate price movements to be rejected and creating DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_allowed_span_percentage_to_price_feed()] [Span Calculation Overflow] If span percentage is very large and multiplied by price, can the calculation overflow and wrap to small values, bypassing span checks? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_manage.move] [Function: set_maximum_effective_price_to_price_feed()] [Boundary Manipulation] Can an attacker set max price to just above current market price, then conduct flash loan attack to push price above max, causing all price feeds to fail?
