  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: vault_receipt] [Share Mismatch] If receipt shares are updated after WithdrawRequest creation, can the request's fixed shares value become invalid, causing execution failures or over-withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: vault_receipt] [Receipt Deletion] Can a receipt be deleted or transferred after WithdrawRequest creation, leaving a dangling receipt_id that causes undefined behavior during execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: vault_receipt] [Cross-Receipt Attack] Can an attacker create multiple WithdrawRequest objects from different receipts totaling more shares than they own, exploiting lack of global share tracking? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: vault_receipt] [Status Manipulation] Can receipt status be manipulated after WithdrawRequest creation to bypass status checks during cancellation or execution? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: share_ratio] [Stale Ratio] Can share ratio change significantly between WithdrawRequest creation and execution, causing the fixed expected_amount to become irrelevant and bypassing slippage protection? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: execution] [Execution Order] Can attackers manipulate execution order of WithdrawRequest objects to execute their requests when vault conditions are favorable and delay others? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: execution] [Partial Execution] If vault has insufficient free_principal, can WithdrawRequest execution fail partially, leaving request in inconsistent state with shares deducted but funds not transferred? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: execution] [Fee Calculation] Can the withdraw_fee_rate change between WithdrawRequest creation and execution, causing users to pay more fees than expected based on expected_amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: execution] [Max Amount Override] Can the operator-provided max_amount_received parameter in execution override user's expected_amount, enabling unauthorized slippage expansion? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: oracle] [Price Staleness] Can expected_amount be based on stale oracle prices at request creation, then execution uses current prices, causing systematic slippage check failures? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: oracle] [Price Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate oracle prices between WithdrawRequest creation and execution to maximize withdrawal amounts beyond expected_amount? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: oracle] [Decimal Mismatch] If oracle prices use different decimals (1e9 vs 1e18), can expected_amount calculations be incorrect, leading to systematic over or under-withdrawals? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: oracle] [Price Precision] Can low-precision oracle prices cause expected_amount to be significantly different from actual withdrawal amounts, bypassing slippage checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: locking_time] [Lock Bypass] Can locking_time_for_cancel_request be zero, allowing immediate cancellation of WithdrawRequest objects and negating the purpose of withdrawal windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: cancellation] [Cancel After Execution] Can a WithdrawRequest be cancelled after execution has begun, causing double-spending where shares are both withdrawn and returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: cancellation] [Recipient Bypass] Since cancellation checks 'recipient == address::from_u256(0)' as valid, can anyone cancel requests with zero recipient, griefing legitimate users? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Integration: cancellation] [Partial Cancellation] Can WithdrawRequest shares be partially cancelled, or must entire request be cancelled, potentially forcing all-or-nothing withdrawal strategy? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Total Shares Check] Does new() lack verification that shares doesn't exceed vault's total_shares, allowing creation of impossible withdrawal requests? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Receipt Ownership] Does new() lack verification that receipt_id is actually owned by the transaction sender or receipt holder? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Address Validation] Does new() lack checks that receipt_id, recipient, and vault_id are non-zero and point to valid objects? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Circular Reference] Can vault_id equal receipt_id, creating circular references that could cause infinite loops or stack overflows in nested lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Duplicate Prevention] Does the module lack mechanisms to prevent duplicate WithdrawRequest creation for the same shares, enabling double-spending attempts? (Critical)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Invariant] [Share Conservation] Is there an invariant ensuring sum of all WithdrawRequest.shares never exceeds vault's total_shares? Where is this enforced? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Invariant] [Request Uniqueness] Is there an invariant ensuring request_id uniqueness across all WithdrawRequest objects in the buffer? Where is this verified? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/sources/requests/withdraw_request.move] [Missing Validation] [Economic Rationality] Does new() lack checks that expected_amount is within reasonable bounds relative to shares and current share ratio? (Medium)"
