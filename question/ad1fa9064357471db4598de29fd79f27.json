  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Racing] Can an attacker monitor diff_threshold2_timer and call update_single_price repeatedly just before max_duration_within_thresholds expires, preventing level_major alerts from triggering? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Historical Price Poisoning] If an attacker can inject a manipulated price that passes all validations once, can this poisoned historical_price then be used to validate future extreme prices through span validation? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Multi-Feed Attack] Can an attacker coordinate price manipulations across multiple feeds to create correlated failures that bypass individual feed validations? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Max Timestamp Diff DoS] If max_timestamp_diff is set to 0, no prices can be fresh (current_timestamp - oracle_timestamp < 0 is impossible) - can admin error or malicious config cause permanent DoS? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Inversion] If price_diff_threshold1 > price_diff_threshold2 due to config error, can validate_price_difference produce inverted severity levels, misclassifying critical deviations as normal? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Effective Price Bounds Invalid] If maximum_effective_price < minimum_effective_price, all prices fail validation - can this config error cause permanent feed unavailability? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Oracle ID Collision] If multiple feeds share the same oracle_id due to config error, can updates to one feed corrupt another feed's state in the PriceOracle? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: get_price_from_adaptor()] [Pair ID Substitution] If pair_id is changed after oracle_provider_config is set, can the assertion at line 177 be bypassed by updating both values simultaneously, allowing wrong price feeds? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [History vs Oracle Price Skew] Lines 162 and 164 update history and oracle price separately - if a transaction reads between these updates, can it observe inconsistent state?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Timer State Corruption] If start_or_continue_diff_threshold2_timer at line 157 fails but doesn't revert, can the timer state become corrupted, causing incorrect severity calculations in future updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Event Emission Ordering] Events are emitted at various return points - can event reordering or omission cause off-chain systems to have incorrect understanding of oracle state? (Low)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Partial Update Rollback] If oracle::update_price at line 164 fails, are the history update at line 162 and timer changes at lines 157/159 rolled back, or can partial state changes persist?

  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Primary-Secondary Flip Attack] Can an attacker alternate between making primary and secondary stale to force continuous oracle source switching, creating price volatility? (High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/protocol/oracle/sources/oracle_pro.move] [Function: update_single_price()] [Threshold Walking] Can an attacker keep primary-secondary price difference just below threshold2 continuously, accumulating small price deviations that bypass major/critical alerts but sum to large manipulation?
