  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Invariant: Pending vs Staked] Can pending balance be counted in both get_pending() and get_total_staked(), causing double-counting in ratio calculations? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Invariant: Collected vs Total Rewards] If collected_rewards > total_rewards due to mut_collected_rewards() abuse, does this break get_total_rewards() underflow protection? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [Reentrancy in Loop] Can validator_set::remove_stakes() at line 443 perform callbacks that modify NativePool state, causing the loop to read stale values? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: collect_fee()] [Transfer Reentrancy] Does transfer::public_transfer() at line 532 allow reentrancy that could call collect_fee() again before the first call completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: unstake_amount_from_validators()] [State Rollback] If stake_pool() at line 491 aborts during restaking, are all state changes from sub_total_staked_unsafe() and sub_rewards_unsafe() rolled back? (High)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Error: E_NOTHING_TO_UNSTAKE] [Empty Validator Vector] If validators vector has length 0 at line 434, does E_NOTHING_TO_UNSTAKE properly indicate the root cause or mask other issues? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Error: E_NOT_ENOUGH_BALANCE] [Balance Assertion Timing] Is the assertion at line 479 checked before or after collectable_reward is capped, potentially causing false positives? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: sub_rewards_unsafe()] [Silent Underflow] At line 285, underflow is silently clamped to 0 - can this hide bugs where rewards are over-deducted? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: get_total_active_stake()] [Epoch Clamping] At line 203, last_active_epoch is clamped to current_epoch - does this correctly handle the case where staked_update_epoch is far in the future? (Low)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: migrate()] [Version Check Weakness] At line 558, migrate() checks version < VERSION but doesn't validate the version is exactly VERSION-1, allowing skipped version migrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: liquid_staking/sources/volo_v1/native_pool.move] [Function: migrate()] [State Corruption on Migrate] Does migrate() at line 557 perform any state validation or cleanup, or can it leave the pool in an inconsistent state if interrupted? (Medium)",
