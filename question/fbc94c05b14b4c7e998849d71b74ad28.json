(High)",
  "[File: volo-vault/local_dependencies/switchboard_sui/on_demand/sources/actions/queue/queue_remove_fee_coin_action.move] [Function: validate()] [Insufficient Test Coverage] Are there tests verifying that validate() correctly rejects unauthorized callers across all possible Queue authority configurations? (Medium)",
