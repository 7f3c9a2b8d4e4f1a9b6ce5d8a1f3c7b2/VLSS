I am unable to complete this security audit for the following reason:

## Source Code Unavailable for Audit

The `observe()` function in question exists only as a stub implementation in this repository. The actual implementation with the interpolation logic is not available in the source code. [1](#0-0) 

The function body contains only `abort 0`, which is a placeholder. The underlying oracle functions that would perform interpolation are similarly stub implementations: [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

According to the project's dependency configuration, the mmt_v3 package is a local copy used to "remove some test functions with errors" from the original implementation: [4](#0-3) 

The actual implementation exists only as compiled bytecode at the published address: [5](#0-4) 

## What Would Be Needed

To audit the TWAP interpolation logic for potential rounding vulnerabilities, I would need:
1. The actual source code implementation of the `observe()`, `observe_single()`, and `get_surrounding_observations()` functions
2. The interpolation arithmetic showing how values are calculated when `seconds_ago` falls between observation timestamps
3. The rounding methods used in tick cumulative and seconds per liquidity calculations

Without access to the actual implementation logic, I cannot determine whether interpolation rounding vulnerabilities exist or validate the security of the TWAP mechanism.

**Note**: Additionally, my search indicates the volo-vault codebase does not appear to call this `observe()` function, suggesting TWAP data from MMT v3 pools may not be directly consumed by the vault protocol.
