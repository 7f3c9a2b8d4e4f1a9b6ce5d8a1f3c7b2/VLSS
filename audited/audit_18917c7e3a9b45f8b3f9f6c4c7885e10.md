## Title
Insufficient Liquidity Recovery in Two-Phase Unstaking Causes Assertion Failure and Fund Lockup

## Summary
The `split_n_sui()` function's two-phase unstaking mechanism cannot guarantee retrieval of the requested SUI amount due to MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD constraints and exchange rate rounding. When the shortfall exceeds the 10 mist tolerance, the assertion fails, preventing users from unstaking their LST tokens and effectively locking their funds until external conditions change.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the two-phase unstaking implementation within `split_n_sui()`. [1](#0-0) 

**Root Cause:**

The function implements a two-phase strategy to unstake SUI from validators:

**Phase 1 (Proportional)**: Unstakes from validators proportionally based on their assigned weights. [2](#0-1) 

**Phase 2 (Sequential)**: Attempts to fill any remaining shortfall by sequentially unstaking from validators. [3](#0-2) 

However, both phases are constrained by multiple factors that prevent guaranteed liquidity recovery:

**Constraint 1 - MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD**: Set to 1 SUI (1,000,000,000 mist). [4](#0-3)  This minimum is enforced in the unstaking logic, preventing partial unstakes that would leave less than 1 SUI staked. [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) 

**Constraint 2 - Exchange Rate Rounding**: The `get_sui_amount()` function uses integer division, causing precision loss in conversion calculations. [7](#0-6) 

**Constraint 3 - Ceiling Calculation**: Unstaking from active stake uses ceiling division that can round up the required fungible staked SUI amount. [8](#0-7) 

**Constraint 4 - Offset Addition**: An ACTIVE_STAKE_REDEEM_OFFSET of 100 mist is added to compensate for rounding. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9) 

After exhausting both phases, the function allows only a 10 mist shortfall tolerance. [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11) 

If the shortfall exceeds this tolerance, the assertion fails with `ENotEnoughSuiInSuiPool`. [13](#0-12) 

**Why Protections Fail:**

The code itself explicitly documents this failure scenario in comments, describing a situation where a user requests 190 SUI but only 175 SUI can be unstaked (15 SUI shortfall = 15,000,000,000 mist), which is 1.5 billion times larger than the 10 mist tolerance. [14](#0-13) 

The vulnerability is triggered through the public `unstake()` function which calls `split_n_sui()`. [15](#0-14) 

## Impact Explanation

**Severity: HIGH**

**Concrete Harm:**
- Users holding LST tokens cannot convert them back to SUI when liquidity is fragmented across validators
- The transaction reverts with `ENotEnoughSuiInSuiPool` error, making unstaking completely impossible
- Funds remain locked until external conditions change (new stakes arrive, epoch rollover, manual rebalancing by operators)

**Affected Parties:**
- Any user attempting to unstake LST tokens when the pool has low liquidity relative to their withdrawal request
- Particularly impacts large withdrawals or withdrawals during/after rebalancing operations

**Quantified Impact:**
- The documented example shows a 15 SUI shortfall on a 190 SUI withdrawal (~7.9% of requested amount locked)
- With MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD at 1 SUI and multiple validators, shortfalls of multiple SUI are realistic
- Users lose complete access to their funds temporarily, representing a critical operational failure

**Severity Justification:**
This warrants HIGH severity because:
1. **Core functionality failure**: Unstaking, a fundamental protocol operation, becomes unavailable
2. **No attack required**: Occurs through normal operations without any admin compromise
3. **Direct fund custody impact**: Temporary but complete lockup of user funds
4. **Widespread effect**: Can affect significant portions of user withdrawals during low liquidity periods

## Likelihood Explanation

**Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Entry Point:**
The vulnerability is triggered through the public `unstake()` function - no special permissions required.

**Preconditions (All Realistic):**
1. Pool has low overall liquidity relative to withdrawal request
2. Validator stakes are unevenly distributed across validators
3. Some validators have stakes close to MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD boundaries
4. Recent rebalancing operations have left small unstakeable amounts in validators

**Execution Practicality:**
- No special permissions required - any user can call `unstake()`
- The scenario is explicitly documented in code comments, confirming developers knew it could occur
- Conditions naturally arise after rebalancing operations followed by periods with insufficient new stakes
- The ratio of MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD (1 billion mist) to tolerance (10 mist) is 100 million:1, making the tolerance demonstrably insufficient

**Economic Rationality:**
- No attack cost - occurs naturally during normal protocol operations
- Higher likelihood after periods of net withdrawals or validator changes
- Cannot be prevented by individual users

**Realistic Triggers:**
- Market volatility causing withdrawal waves
- Post-rebalancing periods with low new deposits
- Multiple validators with varying stake amounts (standard configuration)

## Recommendation

**Immediate Fixes:**

1. **Increase ACCEPTABLE_MIST_ERROR to a reasonable value** (e.g., 0.1 SUI = 100,000,000 mist) to account for MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD constraints:
```move
const ACCEPTABLE_MIST_ERROR: u64 = 100_000_000; // 0.1 SUI
```

2. **Implement graceful degradation** - allow partial withdrawals when full amount cannot be recovered:
```move
// Instead of asserting, return what's available
let available_amount = min(safe_max_sui_amount_out, self.sui_pool.value());
self.split_from_sui_pool(available_amount)
```

3. **Add emergency liquidity buffer** - maintain a minimum sui_pool balance to handle edge cases.

**Long-term Solutions:**

1. **Implement withdrawal queue system** for large withdrawals that exceed available liquidity
2. **Add explicit minimum liquidity checks** before allowing rebalancing operations
3. **Provide users with liquidity preview** before executing unstake transactions

## Proof of Concept

The vulnerability is explicitly documented by the developers in the code comments. A test demonstrating this scenario would:

1. Set up a stake pool with two validators with equal weights
2. Distribute stakes unevenly (e.g., [90 SUI, 110 SUI])
3. Trigger rebalancing to target distribution
4. Immediately attempt to withdraw a large amount (e.g., 190 SUI)
5. Observe that the two-phase unstaking cannot recover sufficient liquidity
6. Transaction reverts with `ENotEnoughSuiInSuiPool` assertion failure

The documented scenario at lines 726-738 of validator_pool.move provides the exact parameters for reproducing this vulnerability.
