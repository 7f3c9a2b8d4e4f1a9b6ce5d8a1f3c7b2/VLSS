## Title
Withdrawal Fee Manipulation Bypasses User Slippage Protection Due to Post-Check Fee Deduction

## Summary
The `expected_amount` slippage protection in withdrawal execution validates the gross withdrawal amount before fee deduction rather than the net amount users receive. This allows admin to increase withdrawal fees after users submit requests, causing users to receive significantly less than their protected expected amount without triggering slippage failures. The issue represents a mis-scoped admin privilege combined with a broken user protection mechanism.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the withdrawal execution flow due to an ordering issue where fee deduction occurs after the `expected_amount` validation check.

In `execute_withdraw`, the withdrawal amount is calculated from shares and validated against user's `expected_amount` BEFORE fees are applied: [1](#0-0) 

However, the withdrawal fee is then deducted AFTER this validation passes, and users receive the net amount: [2](#0-1) 

The admin can change withdrawal fees at any time without restrictions beyond the fee cap, using only AdminCap authorization: [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) 

The maximum withdrawal fee is capped at 5% (500 basis points): [5](#0-4) 

Users cannot immediately cancel their withdrawal requests due to a configurable locking period (default 5 minutes): [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

Meanwhile, operators can execute withdrawal requests immediately with no time constraints - the `execute_withdraw` function has no request time checks: [8](#0-7) 

This contrasts sharply with the deposit flow, which correctly protects users by deducting fees BEFORE calculating shares and validating against `expected_shares`: [9](#0-8) 

In deposits, fees are deducted first (lines 830-836), then shares are calculated from the net value (line 844), then validated (lines 849-850). This ensures `expected_shares` protection works correctly even if fees change.

## Impact Explanation

This vulnerability breaks a critical user protection invariant and enables direct financial loss:

**Quantified Impact Scenario:**
- User submits withdrawal request expecting default 0.1% fee (10 bps) [10](#0-9) 
- User sets `expected_amount = 990` tokens (allowing for price slippage)
- Admin increases fee to maximum 5% (500 bps) before execution
- Withdrawal calculation: `amount_to_withdraw = 1000` tokens
- Validation passes: `1000 >= 990` ✓
- Fee deduction: `1000 × 5% = 50` tokens
- User receives: `950` tokens instead of expected ~`999` tokens

The user loses approximately 49 tokens (4.9% of expected value) with no slippage protection triggering. With the 5% fee cap, this represents systematic extraction of up to 4.9% additional value from any pending withdrawal.

The impact is direct fund loss to users through a broken protection mechanism. Users reasonably expect `expected_amount` to protect the net amount they receive, but it only validates the gross pre-fee amount.

## Likelihood Explanation

**High Likelihood** - This vulnerability is trivially exploitable through normal protocol operations:

**Attack Preconditions:**
- Pending withdrawal requests exist (normal protocol state)
- Admin has access to AdminCap (normal operational role)

**Execution Path:**
1. Users submit withdrawal requests via `user_entry::withdraw` with `expected_amount` based on current ~0.1% fees [11](#0-10) 
2. Admin calls `vault_manage::set_withdraw_fee` to increase fees (up to 500 bps) [3](#0-2) 
3. Operator immediately calls `operation::execute_withdraw` [12](#0-11) 
4. Users receive significantly less than expected without protection triggering
5. Users cannot cancel due to 5-minute locking period

**Realistic Scenarios:**
- Accidental: Admin changes global fee policy without realizing impact on pending requests
- Opportunistic: Admin increases fees when large withdrawal requests are pending
- No technical barriers or complex setup required

The vulnerability stems from mis-scoped admin privileges: admins can change fees affecting pending user requests while users have no effective recourse due to the cancellation lock and immediate operator execution capability.

## Recommendation

Fix the ordering in `execute_withdraw` to match the deposit flow pattern:

1. Calculate `amount_to_withdraw` from shares
2. **Deduct fee immediately** to get net amount
3. Validate the **net amount** against `expected_amount`
4. Transfer net amount to user

This ensures `expected_amount` protects the actual amount users receive, not the pre-fee amount. Alternatively, add a time delay before fee changes take effect for pending requests, or allow immediate cancellation when fees are increased.

}
```

## Notes

This vulnerability is particularly severe because:

1. **Broken Security Invariant**: The `expected_amount` parameter is explicitly designed to protect users from receiving less than expected, but it fails to do so when fees change.

2. **Asymmetric Protection**: Deposits correctly protect users by deducting fees before validation, but withdrawals do not, creating an inconsistent security model.

3. **Time-Based Attack Window**: The 5-minute cancellation lock combined with immediate operator execution creates a window where users have no recourse.

4. **Privilege Mis-scoping**: While admin roles are trusted, the ability to change fees affecting existing user requests without any safeguards or delays represents poor privilege scoping.

5. **High Impact Ceiling**: With the 5% fee cap, this can systematically extract up to 4.9% additional value from any pending withdrawal request.

The fix should ensure `expected_amount` validates the actual net amount users receive after all deductions, matching the security guarantee users reasonably expect from this protection parameter.
