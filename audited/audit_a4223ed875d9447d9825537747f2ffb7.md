# Investigation Result: Unable to Audit Due to Missing Source Code

After thorough investigation of the MMT v3 codebase, I cannot perform a meaningful security audit of the observation vector overflow vulnerability because **the actual implementation source code is not available in this repository**.

## Key Findings:

### 1. All MMT v3 Functions Are Stubs

The `mmt_v3` module contains only interface definitions with stub implementations: [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

Every function in the MMT v3 codebase simply executes `abort 0`, providing no actual implementation logic to audit.

### 2. Pool Structure Has Observation Fields But No Implementation

The Pool struct defines observation-related fields: [3](#0-2) 

However, there is no accessible code that shows how these fields are manipulated when `observation_cardinality_next` is modified.

### 3. Configuration Confirms Interface-Only Code [4](#0-3) 

The commented-out section shows the actual implementation is from a separate interface repository, with the real bytecode published on-chain at address `0x70285592c97965e811e0c6f98dccc3a9c2b4ad854b3594faab9597ada267b860`.

## Conclusion

**I cannot audit this vulnerability** because:
- The source code for observation vector management logic is not available
- Only stub interfaces exist in the repository
- The actual implementation is compiled bytecode on-chain
- Without source code, I cannot trace how `observation_cardinality_next` interacts with the observations vector, whether bounds checking exists, or if out-of-bounds access is possible

To perform this security audit, the actual MMT v3 implementation source code would need to be provided, not just the interface definitions.
