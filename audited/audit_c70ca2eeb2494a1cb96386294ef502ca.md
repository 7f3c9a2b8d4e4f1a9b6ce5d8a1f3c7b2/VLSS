## Title
Frozen Operators Can Bypass Freeze Mechanism to Extract Vault Fees

## Summary
The `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` function in `manage.move` does not verify that the OperatorCap has been frozen before allowing fee retrieval operations. This allows frozen operators to bypass the operator freeze security mechanism and continue extracting accumulated deposit/withdraw fees even after administrators have frozen their capabilities.

## Finding Description

The Volo vault implements an operator freeze mechanism where admins can disable specific operators via the `Operation` shared object's `freezed_operators` table. [1](#0-0) 

The freeze check function `assert_operator_not_freezed` is designed to abort with `ERR_OPERATOR_FREEZED` when a frozen operator attempts any operation. [2](#0-1) 

All operator functions in `operation.move` properly call this freeze check at their entry point. For example, `start_op_with_bag` [3](#0-2) , `execute_deposit` [4](#0-3) , `batch_execute_deposit` [5](#0-4) , and `execute_withdraw` [6](#0-5)  all follow this pattern.

Similarly, all operator functions in `reward_manager.move` properly enforce the freeze check, such as in `add_new_reward_type` [7](#0-6)  and `create_reward_buffer_distribution` [8](#0-7) .

However, the `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` function in `manage.move` does NOT perform this freeze check. [9](#0-8) 

This function takes an `&OperatorCap` parameter but does NOT take the `Operation` shared object, does NOT call `vault::assert_operator_not_freezed(operation, cap)`, and directly calls the vault's internal `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee` function [10](#0-9)  without freeze verification.

The root cause is inconsistent enforcement of the freeze mechanism - while all other operator functions require the `Operation` object to check freeze status, this function omits both the parameter and the check. The protocol explicitly tests that frozen operators should be blocked from operations with `ERR_OPERATOR_FREEZED`. [11](#0-10) 

## Impact Explanation

**Direct Fund Impact:**
When an admin freezes an operator (typically due to suspected compromise or malicious behavior), the expectation is that ALL operator privileges are immediately revoked. However, a frozen operator can still call `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` to extract all accumulated deposit and withdraw fees from the vault.

The vault collects fees from every deposit and withdraw operation, storing them in `deposit_withdraw_fee_collected`. [12](#0-11)  These fees can accumulate to substantial amounts depending on vault activity. A frozen operator can drain the entire fee balance.

**Security Integrity Impact:**
This violates the critical invariant that "operator freeze respected" must hold at all times. The freeze mechanism becomes unreliable as a security control, undermining the admin's ability to respond to security incidents involving compromised or malicious operators.

**Affected Parties:**
- Protocol treasury (loses rightful fee revenue)
- Vault depositors (indirectly affected by reduced protocol sustainability)
- Admin trust in security controls

The severity is HIGH because it represents a complete bypass of an explicit security control mechanism designed to protect protocol funds.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Reachability:** The function is publicly callable by any holder of an OperatorCap.

**Preconditions:**
1. An operator must have been created and granted an OperatorCap
2. The operator must have been frozen by admin using `set_operator_freezed` [13](#0-12) 
3. Deposit/withdraw fees must have accumulated in the vault

**Execution:** The exploit is trivially simple - a frozen operator just calls the function with their OperatorCap. No complex transaction sequences or timing requirements.

**Detection:** The freeze mechanism is intended as an emergency response to suspicious operator behavior. The window between detection and freeze action provides opportunity for exploitation. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker might act normally until frozen, then exploit this vulnerability as a final extraction.

**Probability:** MEDIUM-HIGH. While it requires the operator to be frozen (suggesting prior suspicious activity), the complete absence of the freeze check makes exploitation certain once the condition is met. Active vaults will continuously accumulate fees, making the target valuable.

## Recommendation

Modify `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` to require the `Operation` shared object parameter and enforce the freeze check:

```move
public fun retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator<PrincipalCoinType>(
    operation: &Operation,  // Add this parameter
    cap: &OperatorCap,
    vault: &mut Vault<PrincipalCoinType>,
    amount: u64,
): Balance<PrincipalCoinType> {
    vault::assert_operator_not_freezed(operation, cap);  // Add this check
    vault.retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee(amount)
}
```

This brings the function in line with all other operator functions in the protocol and properly enforces the freeze mechanism.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = vault::ERR_OPERATOR_FREEZED)]
public fun test_retrieve_fee_operator_freezed_should_fail() {
    let mut s = test_scenario::begin(OWNER);
    let mut clock = clock::create_for_testing(s.ctx());
    
    // Initialize vault
    init_vault::init_vault(&mut s, &mut clock);
    init_vault::init_create_vault<SUI_TEST_COIN>(&mut s);
    
    // Create operator and freeze it
    s.next_tx(OWNER);
    {
        let admin_cap = s.take_from_sender<AdminCap>();
        let mut operation = s.take_shared<Operation>();
        let operator_cap = vault_manage::create_operator_cap(&admin_cap, s.ctx());
        let operator_id = operator_cap.operator_id();
        
        // Freeze the operator
        vault_manage::set_operator_freezed(&admin_cap, &mut operation, operator_id, true);
        
        transfer::public_transfer(operator_cap, OWNER);
        test_scenario::return_shared(operation);
        s.return_to_sender(admin_cap);
    };
    
    // Frozen operator attempts to retrieve fees - should fail but doesn't
    s.next_tx(OWNER);
    {
        let mut vault = s.take_shared<Vault<SUI_TEST_COIN>>();
        let operator_cap = s.take_from_sender<OperatorCap>();
        
        // This should abort with ERR_OPERATOR_FREEZED but currently succeeds
        let fee_balance = vault_manage::retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator(
            &operator_cap,
            &mut vault,
            100
        );
        
        fee_balance.destroy_for_testing();
        test_scenario::return_shared(vault);
        s.return_to_sender(operator_cap);
    };
    
    clock.destroy_for_testing();
    s.end();
}
```
