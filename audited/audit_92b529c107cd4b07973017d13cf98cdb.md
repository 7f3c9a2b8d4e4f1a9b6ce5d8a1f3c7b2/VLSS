# Investigation Result

After thorough investigation, I cannot properly audit this security concern because the actual implementation of the `abs()` function is not present in the repository.

## Findings

The `mmt_v3::i64` module exists only as stub code in the repository: [1](#0-0) 

All functions in this file contain only `abort 0` statements rather than actual implementations.

The mmt_v3 package references an on-chain deployment: [2](#0-1) 

This is a common Sui Move pattern where local source files contain only interface stubs, while the actual bytecode implementation exists at the published on-chain address `0xc84b1ef2ac2ba5c3018e2b8c956ba5d0391e0e46d1daa1926d5a99a6a42526b4`.

## Limitation

Per the audit requirements, I need "exact file/function/line references" and "root cause clearly identified" to report a vulnerability. Since the actual implementation code is not present in this repository, I cannot:

- Examine the actual abs() implementation to determine if it unnecessarily manipulates sign bits for positive values
- Provide specific line numbers showing problematic code
- Demonstrate concrete impact on vault calculations
- Validate or invalidate the security concern

**This investigation falls outside my current capabilities** as I can only audit code present in the repository. The actual mmt_v3 implementation would need to be obtained from the on-chain deployment or the original source repository to properly investigate this concern.
