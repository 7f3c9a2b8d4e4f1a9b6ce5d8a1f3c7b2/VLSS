## Title
Arithmetic Overflow in Percentage-Based Fee Calculations Causes DoS for Large Transactions

## Summary
The lending_core module performs unsafe u64 * u64 multiplication in fee calculations without intermediate u128 casting, causing arithmetic overflow and transaction abortion for large but realistic loan amounts. This affects flash loan and borrow operations, creating a denial-of-service condition that limits protocol scalability.

## Finding Description

Two critical locations perform unsafe percentage calculations that overflow for large amounts:

**Location 1: Flash Loan Fee Calculation**

The flash loan module calculates fees by multiplying `_loan_amount` (u64) directly by fee rates (u64) without casting to u128. [1](#0-0) 

**Location 2: Borrow Fee Calculation**

The `get_borrow_fee` function in incentive_v3 multiplies `amount` (u64) directly by `borrow_fee_rate` (u64) without casting to u128. [2](#0-1) 

**Root Cause Analysis**

Both operations multiply two u64 values before dividing by the percentage benchmark (10000). [3](#0-2)  When the intermediate multiplication result exceeds u64::MAX (18,446,744,073,709,551,615), the Move VM aborts the transaction.

**Overflow Thresholds**

For flash loans, the rate constraint requires that `rate_to_supplier + rate_to_treasury < 10000`. [4](#0-3)  With rates summing near 9999, overflow occurs when loan amounts exceed approximately 1.8 million SUI.

For borrows, the fee rate is capped at 10% (1000 basis points). [5](#0-4)  Overflow occurs when borrow amounts exceed approximately 18.4 million SUI.

**Why Existing Protections Fail**

Flash loan validation only checks that amounts fall within configured min/max bounds. [6](#0-5)  However, these bounds themselves are not validated against overflow safety. The `cfg.max` value can be set to any u64 value as long as it exceeds `cfg.min`, with no constraint preventing overflow when multiplied by rates.

Borrow validation only checks supply balance sufficiency and borrow cap ratios, not overflow safety. [7](#0-6) 

**Inconsistent Pattern**

The codebase demonstrates awareness of the correct overflow-safe pattern. The liquid staking fee_config module casts to u128 before multiplication in all fee calculations. [8](#0-7)  This safe pattern is not applied in lending_core percentage calculations.

## Impact Explanation

This vulnerability causes operational denial-of-service with **Medium severity**:

1. **Flash Loan Limitation**: Users cannot execute flash loans above ~1.8 million SUI with high fee rates. Flash loans are specifically designed for large arbitrage and liquidation operations that regularly approach or exceed this threshold in mature DeFi protocols.

2. **Borrow Limitation**: Users cannot borrow above ~18.4 million SUI when the maximum 10% borrow fee is enabled. While higher than the flash loan threshold, this becomes realistic as the protocol scales and institutional users participate.

3. **Protocol Growth Impact**: As total value locked increases, the protocol becomes unable to serve its largest users, limiting competitive positioning against other lending protocols that can handle larger transactions.

4. **No Workaround**: Unlike many operations that can be split into multiple transactions, flash loans must be atomic by design. Users cannot work around the limitation.

The severity is Medium (not High) because:
- No funds are at risk - the Move VM abort prevents silent corruption
- Protocol functionality remains intact for amounts below the thresholds
- The impact is availability (DoS) rather than fund loss or corruption

## Likelihood Explanation

This vulnerability has **High likelihood** of being encountered:

1. **Accessible Entry Points**: Both vulnerable code paths are reachable through public functions callable by any user. Flash loans are accessible via `flash_loan_with_ctx` and `flash_loan_with_account_cap`. [9](#0-8)  Borrows are accessible via `entry_borrow`, `borrow`, and `borrow_with_account_cap`. [10](#0-9) 

2. **Realistic Amounts**: The overflow thresholds fall within typical DeFi transaction ranges. Major protocols regularly process flash loans of $50M-$200M. With SUI priced at $3-5, 1.8M SUI represents $5.4M-$9M, which is achievable for sophisticated arbitrageurs and liquidators.

3. **Legitimate Usage**: This is not an attack scenario - users encounter this during normal, legitimate operations. A whale user attempting a large flash loan or institutional borrower will experience unexpected transaction failures.

4. **No Privileges Required**: Any user can trigger the overflow by simply calling public functions with amounts above the threshold. No admin rights or special capabilities are needed.

5. **Growing Probability**: As the protocol's TVL grows and attracts larger users, the likelihood of encountering these thresholds increases naturally.

## Recommendation

Apply the overflow-safe pattern consistently across all percentage calculations by casting to u128 before multiplication:

**For Flash Loans:**
```move
let to_supplier = ((_loan_amount as u128) * (cfg.rate_to_supplier as u128) / (constants::FlashLoanMultiple() as u128)) as u64;
let to_treasury = ((_loan_amount as u128) * (cfg.rate_to_treasury as u128) / (constants::FlashLoanMultiple() as u128)) as u64;
```

**For Borrow Fees:**
```move
fun get_borrow_fee(incentive: &Incentive, amount: u64): u64 {
    if (incentive.borrow_fee_rate > 0) {
        (((amount as u128) * (incentive.borrow_fee_rate as u128) / (constants::percentage_benchmark() as u128)) as u64)
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

This pattern matches the existing safe implementation in the liquid staking module and eliminates the overflow risk while maintaining the same calculation logic.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
fun test_flash_loan_overflow() {
    // Setup test environment with flash loan config
    let ctx = tx_context::dummy();
    
    // Create flash loan config with high rate (9999 bps)
    // Create pool with sufficient liquidity
    
    // Attempt flash loan with amount that causes overflow:
    // loan_amount = 1_846_000_000_000_000 MIST (1.846M SUI)
    // Calculation: 1_846_000_000_000_000 * 9999 = overflow > u64::MAX
    
    // Expected: Transaction aborts with arithmetic error
    flash_loan_with_ctx<SUI>(config, pool, 1_846_000_000_000_000, &mut ctx);
}

#[test]
fun test_borrow_fee_overflow() {
    // Setup test environment with incentive_v3 and 10% borrow fee
    let ctx = tx_context::dummy();
    
    // Set borrow_fee_rate to 1000 (10%, maximum allowed)
    
    // Attempt borrow with amount that causes overflow:
    // amount = 18_447_000_000_000_000 MIST (18.447M SUI)
    // Calculation: 18_447_000_000_000_000 * 1000 = overflow > u64::MAX
    
    // Expected: Transaction aborts with arithmetic error
    entry_borrow<SUI>(clock, oracle, storage, pool, asset, 18_447_000_000_000_000, incentive_v2, incentive_v3, &mut ctx);
}
```
