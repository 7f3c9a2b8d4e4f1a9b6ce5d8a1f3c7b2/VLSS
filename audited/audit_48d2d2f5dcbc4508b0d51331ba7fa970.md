## Title
Frozen Operators Can Bypass Freeze Mechanism to Extract Vault Fees

## Summary
The `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` function in `manage.move` does not verify operator freeze status before allowing fee retrieval, enabling frozen operators to continue extracting accumulated deposit/withdraw fees from the vault even after administrators have frozen their capabilities.

## Finding Description

The Volo vault implements a comprehensive operator freeze mechanism where administrators can disable specific operators through the `Operation` shared object's `freezed_operators` table. [1](#0-0) 

The protocol enforces this freeze through the `assert_operator_not_freezed` function, which aborts with `ERR_OPERATOR_FREEZED` when a frozen operator attempts any operation. [2](#0-1) 

All operator functions in `operation.move` properly call this freeze check at their entry point, including `start_op_with_bag`, [3](#0-2)  `execute_deposit`, [4](#0-3)  and `end_op_value_update_with_bag`. [5](#0-4) 

Similarly, all operator functions in `reward_manager.move` properly enforce the freeze check, such as in `add_new_reward_type`. [6](#0-5) 

**However, the `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` function critically fails to perform this freeze check.** [7](#0-6) 

This function:
1. Takes an `&OperatorCap` parameter but does NOT take the `&Operation` shared object
2. Does NOT call `vault::assert_operator_not_freezed(operation, cap)` 
3. Directly calls the vault's internal fee retrieval function without freeze verification

The internal function it calls simply splits from the accumulated fee balance. [8](#0-7) 

The root cause is inconsistent enforcement - while all other operator functions require the `Operation` object to verify freeze status, this function omits both the parameter and the security check entirely.

## Impact Explanation

**Direct Fund Impact:**
When an administrator freezes an operator (typically due to suspected compromise or malicious behavior), the expectation is that ALL operator privileges are immediately revoked. However, a frozen operator can still call `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` to extract all accumulated deposit and withdraw fees from the vault.

The vault collects fees from every deposit and withdraw operation, storing them in the `deposit_withdraw_fee_collected` balance field. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9)  These fees can accumulate to substantial amounts depending on vault activity volume.

**Security Control Bypass:**
This represents a complete bypass of an explicit security control mechanism. The freeze functionality exists specifically to provide administrators with emergency response capability against compromised or malicious operators. When this control can be circumvented, the protocol's security posture is fundamentally weakened.

**Affected Parties:**
- Protocol treasury loses rightful fee revenue
- Vault depositors are indirectly affected through reduced protocol sustainability
- Administrator trust in security controls is undermined

The severity is HIGH because it enables direct extraction of protocol funds through bypassing an intentional security mechanism.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Reachability:** The function is publicly accessible and callable by any holder of an OperatorCap. [7](#0-6) 

**Preconditions:**
1. An operator has been created and granted an OperatorCap (standard operational state)
2. The operator has been frozen by admin using `set_operator_freezed` [11](#0-10) 
3. Deposit/withdraw fees have accumulated in the vault (occurs naturally during normal operations)

**Execution Simplicity:** 
The exploit requires only a single function call with the operator's existing OperatorCap. No complex transaction sequences, timing requirements, or additional privileges are needed.

**Realistic Scenario:**
The freeze mechanism exists as an emergency response tool. When administrators detect suspicious operator behavior and activate the freeze, the compromised operator has a window to exploit this vulnerability as a final extraction before complete revocation.

**Probability Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH
While it requires the specific condition of an operator being frozen, the complete absence of the freeze check makes exploitation certain once that condition is met. Active vaults continuously accumulate fees, ensuring a valuable target is always available.

## Recommendation

Add the `Operation` shared object parameter and freeze status check to `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator`:

```move
public fun retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator<PrincipalCoinType>(
    operation: &Operation,  // Add this parameter
    cap: &OperatorCap,
    vault: &mut Vault<PrincipalCoinType>,
    amount: u64,
): Balance<PrincipalCoinType> {
    vault::assert_operator_not_freezed(operation, cap);  // Add this check
    vault.retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee(amount)
}
```

This ensures consistency with all other operator functions and properly enforces the freeze mechanism.

## Proof of Concept

```move
#[test]
fun test_frozen_operator_can_extract_fees() {
    let mut scenario = test_scenario::begin(ADMIN);
    
    // Setup: Create vault with accumulated fees
    let admin_cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(scenario.ctx()) };
    let operator_cap = vault::create_operator_cap(scenario.ctx());
    let mut operation = Operation { 
        id: object::new(scenario.ctx()),
        freezed_operators: table::new(scenario.ctx())
    };
    let mut vault = create_test_vault_with_fees(scenario.ctx()); // Vault with 1000 fee balance
    
    // Admin freezes the operator
    vault_manage::set_operator_freezed(
        &admin_cap,
        &mut operation,
        operator_cap.operator_id(),
        true
    );
    
    // Verify operator is frozen
    assert!(vault::operator_freezed(&operation, operator_cap.operator_id()));
    
    // EXPLOIT: Frozen operator can still extract fees!
    let extracted_fees = vault_manage::retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator(
        &operator_cap,
        &mut vault,
        1000
    );
    
    // Verify the exploit succeeded
    assert!(extracted_fees.value() == 1000); // Frozen operator successfully extracted fees!
    
    extracted_fees.destroy_for_testing();
    test_scenario::end(scenario);
}
```

This test demonstrates that a frozen operator can successfully call `retrieve_deposit_withdraw_fee_operator` and extract fees, proving the freeze mechanism is bypassed.
